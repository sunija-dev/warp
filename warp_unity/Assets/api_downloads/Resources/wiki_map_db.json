      "strName": "Shiverpeak Mountains",
      "strWikiText": "The Shiverpeak Mountains, also simply called the Shiverpeaks, rise up over ten-thousand feet above sea level and is a vast mountain range spanning most of Tyria, running north to south and dividing it in two. To the east of the mountains lie charr territories, and just to the west lies the human kingdom of Kryta. There is a known bloodstone in a cave in the south-western area of the Shiverpeaks, though that area may now be considered part of the Steamspur Mountains. The norn city Hoelbrak is located at the center of the Shiverpeaks.\nThe mountains had long been the home of the stout dwarves, who, in preparation for battle with the Great Destroyer in 1078 AE, were mostly transformed into living stone, their grand civilization abandoned in pursuit of victory. Since then, the dragon of ice and snow, Jormag, has awoken in the northern Shiverpeaks and caused earthquakes to shatter the mountains. The ravines filled with water from the northern water and created inland seas such as Frostgorge Sound within the Shiverpeaks. Jormag also forced various races from their homelands, including the norn and the kodan. In the south, the norn now do battle with the dredge, who rose from Sorrow's Furnace after the defeat of their former slave masters and now jealously guard their territories and their freedoms.\n\n\n== Landscape ==\nWith soaring peaks reaching high into the sky (up over ten-thousand feet above sea level), the ice of the Shiverpeaks never melts, and it snows year round. Because the majority of the lakes and rivers in and around the mountains are frozen most of the time, conventional ships find it impossible to traverse them, though the dwarven sled ships and the kodan sanctuaries can pass over them with ease.\nWinding passes, sluggish glaciers, frozen forests, frosted plains, and snow fallen hills make up the majority of the terrain between the mountain peaks, and life can be encountered anywhere.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nCities\nHoelbrak\nEye of the North\nExplorable zones\nCore Game\nWayfarer Foothills (1-15)\nSnowden Drifts (15-25)\nLornar's Pass (25-40)\nDredgehaunt Cliffs (40-50)\nTimberline Falls (50-60)\nFrostgorge Sound (70-80)\nLiving World Season 3\nBitterfrost Frontier (80)\nLiving World Season 4\nThunderhead Peaks (80)\nThe Icebrood Saga\nBjora Marches (80)\nDrizzlewood Coast (80)\nDungeons\nSorrow's Embrace (60, 65)\nHonor of the Waves (76, 80)\n\n\n== Shiverpeak Explorer achievement ==\nThis achievement consists of discovering all 175 areas within the Shiverpeaks.

      "strName": "Ascalon",
      "strWikiText": "Ascalon is the domain of Iron Legion charr. It is a temperate, moderately lush region that has been fought for by the charr and humans for centuries. Countless conflicts and major magical disasters have left their mark on the landscape and people inhabiting the land, namely, the charr invasion and Searing of Ascalon, the Foefire and the creation of Dragonbrand. To this day, the charr High Legions continue to struggle with the aftereffects of those events such as the Ascalonian ghosts, the rogue Flame Legion and Branded minions of the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land known as Ascalon was originally claimed by the charr sometime before 100 BE when they conquered the indigenous Forgotten, though if they had any name for the region is not known. However, they were driven north into the region referred to as the Blood Legion Homelands by humans pushing north and east. The ongoing human-charr conflict lasted for around 1,100 years, culminating at the end of the Third Guild War when the human kingdom of Ascalon was all but destroyed by the charr shamans using magical cauldrons granted to them by titans under orders of Abaddon, the fallen human god. The event became known as the Searing, and it left all of Ascalon scorched and barren in 1070 AE.\nFollowing the Searing, renewed charr war efforts placed the remaining human population of Ascalon in ever-increasing jeopardy. While King Adelbern led a resistance against the charr, his son Rurik led many of the survivors to Kryta in search of refuge. Though Rurik himself was slain by the Stone Summit dwarves, the remaining refugees established the Ascalon Settlement and eventually the Rurikton district of Divinity's Reach. Thirty years after the Searing, Adelbern and his guard made their last stand during a siege on Ascalon City. Using the powers of his ancient sword Magdaer, the king summoned the Foefire which engulfed most of Ascalon, killing the charr in immediate vicinity but effectively killing all humans in Ascalon and transforming their spirits into vengeful ghosts bent on fighting the charr eternally.\nIn the two centuries since then, the once barren lands have slowly recovered and life has gradually returned, though scars of the Searing and ruins of the human kingdom still mark the landscape. On the site of Rin, the ancient capital of the human kingdom of Ascalon, the Iron Legion have raised their Black Citadel. Their war against living humans continued until recent years against the lone fortress of Ebonhawke which is now the last human settlement of Ascalonian heritage. The ghosts of Foefire continue to defend their ruined realm as defiantly as centuries ago.\nThe year 1320 AE was by all standards the most remarkable year in history of Ascalon; the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik awoke in north, in the Blood Legion homelands. It flew south to the Crystal Desert, passing above Ascalon and creating a swath of corruption in its wake which became known as the Dragonbrand. Countless charr and wildlife were immediately transformed into minions of the dragon known as the branded. This severely crippled the war effort of charr against the last human stronghold, urging both participants to seek truce in 1324 which evolved into ongoing peace negotiations as of 1325. The credit for achieving the truce often goes to Queen Jennah's efforts to end the war, and the retrieval of the Claw of the Khan-Ur by Dougal Keane of Ebonhawke and Ember Doomforge of the Ash Legion. Separatist humans and Renegade charr still fight to keep the ancient war alive, preferring to fight their own people rather than accept peace with their sworn enemies.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDue to its lush and arid climate zones, Ascalon is populated by wide variety of flora and fauna. Besides being largely populated by the charr, the region also serves as home for ogres of Blazeridge Mountains and the tribal grawl, among other sentient and semi-sentient creatures. Aside from the human Separatists, the only notable human settlement is the Stronghold of Ebonhawke hugging the southern Blazeridge Mountains. Several enemy factions occupy vast territories in Ascalon: Ascalonian ghosts can be encountered along the Northern Wall and in the Ascalon City Ruins, and the Flame Legion dominates the area north of the wall. Kralkatorriks minions, the branded, swarm through the Dragonbrand and beyond.\nThe geography of Ascalon was completely transformed from its lush and idyllic environment to a barren wasteland of ash following the Searing. The magic ritual also left large crystal formations in the landscape, some of which continue to exist. Following two and half centuries of recovery from the ecological catastrophe, the land is slowly returning to life. Its progress is threatened by not only the Elder Dragon's influence but also by the Flame Legion's destructive magics.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nCities\nBlack Citadel\nExplorable zones\nCore Game\nPlains of Ashford (1–15)\nDiessa Plateau (15–25)\nFields of Ruin (30–40)\nBlazeridge Steppes (40–50)\nIron Marches (50–60)\nFireheart Rise (60–70)\nThe Icebrood Saga\nGrothmar Valley (80)\nDungeons\nAscalonian Catacombs (30, 35)\nCitadel of Flame (70, 75)\n\n\n== Ascalon Explorer achievement ==\nThis achievement consists of discovering 177 areas (out of a possible 178) within Ascalon.

      "strName": "Ruins of Orr",
      "strWikiText": "The Ruins of Orr are situated on a peninsula south of Ascalon and west of the Crystal Desert. They are the destroyed remains of one of the three Tyrian human kingdoms which was once a vibrant, proud, and prosperous nation. Orrians believed themselves to be the favored of the Six Human Gods, living in the shadows of Arah which had once been inhabited by the gods themselves. Since the awakening of the Elder Dragon Zhaitan caused the Rising of Orr from the depths of the Sea of Sorrows, the landscape has become twisted while the nation's former inhabitants have fallen into Zhaitan's corruption and become its Risen minions. Despite Orr's dark fate, however, hope still lingers deep within it, and the fallen land may still have a chance to be healed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAt the end of the Elder Dragons' previous rise, around the time of the disappearance of the Great Giants over ten millenia ago, the Elder Dragon Zhaitan slept deep beneath Orr, until the day it would rise again. In the millennia that followed, the Six Human Gods arrived from the Mists, and made Orr a green and flowering expanse. They followed a source of magic coming from the Artesian Waters and built a city, which they called Arah, over the subterranean waterway.\nLater, the humans came to Orr in 205 BE where, under the guidance of King Doric, they created the human system of governance and an empire that spanned the northern continent. Eventually, the empire fragmented into the three historical nations, of which only Kryta remains today. When the gods left the world in the Exodus of the Gods, the Orrian people took on the protection of the holy city of Arah as their sacred charge in hopes of the gods' return. Even after the Exodus, Orrians practiced magic in an everyday fashion that would have seemed strange to visitors.\nThe Orrian nation lasted until the end of the Third Guild War in 1071 AE, when Vizier Khilbron, desperate to protect Arah from the charr invasion that had already ravaged Ascalon, read from one of the Lost Scrolls. The invocation unleashed dark magic that defeated the charr, but also sank the nation of Orr to the bottom of the ocean, taking its people and its cities with it. All that were left above the surface of Orr were the wandering undead, who, under the control of the Vizier (now an undead lich lord), were to play a key role in the fulfillment of the Flameseeker Prophecies. This event became known as the Cataclysm. According to sailor stories, the gods themselves turned Khilbron into a lich in penance for his actions.\nFor years after the Cataclysm, Orr sat on the floor of the Bay of Sirens which became known as the Sea of Sorrows due to the events that had transpired there. Few sailed near its cursed shores, and much of the nation's treasures remained ripe for the pillaging, making the shattered peninsula an ideal location for corsairs fleeing Istani law to dock.\nIn 1219 AE, Zhaitan awoke and brought the sunken nation of Orr to the surface. The act wiped out the area's corsair inhabitants and much of the wildlife remaining there, raising them from the dead as Zhaitan's Risen army, causing a Great Tsunami in the process. In the century since, Zhaitan ruled over the fallen landmass and the Strait of Malchor with an unwavering grip. Despite the dragon's corruption, however, a slow life still pulsed in the beleaguered nation's veins.\n\n\n=== Personal story ===\n\nThe eldest of the sylvari Firstborn, Trahearne, threw himself into studying Orr after being given a Wyld Hunt to restore the land. He often traveled to Orr to explore and study it alone, but when he learned that Zhaitan's forces planned to attack Lion's Arch in 1325 AE, he traveled to Claw Island to warn the Lionguard stationed there, albeit too late. The defeat at the Battle of Claw Island made Trahearne seek guidance of the Pale Tree along with a trusted friend of one of the three great Orders of Tyria. In a vision of a possible future shown to Trahearne and his friend in the Dream of Dreams, the spirit of King Reza, the last king of Orr, gave a warning: while Zhaitan could be defeated, Orr could only be healed from the dragon's corruption by \"seeking the source.\" To accomplish this, Trahearne was given Caladbolg, a legendary greatsword created from the bark of the Pale Tree.\nWith the aid of his friend, Trahearne convinced the three Orders to join forces and form the Pact to fight the dragons with himself as marshal and his friend as the Pact Commander. After reclaiming Claw Island from the Risen, Trahearne led the Pact into victory after victory, reaching Orr and the doorstep of Arah itself. There, he and the Commander traveled to the Artesian Waters, the Source of Orr, from which all Orr's waters and natural magic flow. Trahearne cast a powerful healing ritual with Caladbolg, freeing Zhaitan's most powerful lieutenants, former kings and queens of Orr, from the dragon's control. As a gesture of thanks, the liberated spirit of King Reza declared the Pact Commander \"Champion of Orr\". With Zhaitan all but crippled, the Pact and Destiny's Edge moved on into the ruins of Arah itself to lure out and defeat the Elder Dragon in a titanic battle in the skies above Orr.\nSince the fall of Zhaitan, the number of Risen in Orr thinned, and for the first time in centuries, Orr had hope in its future. Scholars from the Durmand Priory used the opportunity created by Zhaitan's fall to explore Arah in detail. They discovered information about the five elder races of dwarves, Forgotten, jotun, mursaat, and Seers, as well as the Bloodstone, while fighting against surviving Risen and securing Zhaitan's severed tail for further study in the Priory's Special Collections. The Inquest led by Operative Brie also explored the city in an attempt to uncover its secrets and successfully enslaved some Risen to do their bidding while clashing with Pact forces.\n\n\n=== Living World Season 3 ===\nThe surviving Risen eventually came to be called the Unchained as they no longer had an Elder Dragon to follow. However, some of the more intelligent Unchained lieutenants such as kingpins rallied their fellow directionless dragon minions to continue the fight in Zhaitan's name.\nIn 1330 AE, a Vigil Warmaster confirmed that the Risen army and corruption lingered and that Orr remained a \"waterlogged wreck\", but progress in cleansing the land of both minions and corruption continued. The Pact Commander entered the Artesian Waters once again and faced a final challenge to restore Caladbolg after it had been broken in the Pact's war against the Elder Dragon Mordremoth.\n\nSome time after the fall of Zhaitan, Siren's Landing was revealed in Orr and attracted Tyrian adventurers, scholars and treasure hunters to explore it. Firstborn Dagonet, sylvari and other races of Tyria continued to work on restoring Orr while entering and studying the newly revealed region. They were joined by King Reza and a number of ghostly Orrian royals and servants, seeking to restore ancient reliquaries devoted to the Six Gods and purge the land of Zhaitan's lingering corruption. Oakhearts helped spread verdance to Siren's Landing albeit at a slow pace as they were clashing with Zhaitan's remaining minions. Lingering ghosts of Orrian musical wizards known as the Sirens of Orr sang the dirges of five gods with the Siren Master teaching curious explorers ways to harness the magical power of these ancient songs.\nThe rogue god Balthazar's mercenaries and fanatical members of the Church of Balthazar appeared in Siren's Landing as well and set up a base of operations at Balthazar's Reliquary while fighting against anyone daring to approach the site. The reveal of Abaddon's intact reliquary, which Balthazar had briefly visited during his return to Tyria and where the Pact Commander and the long-lived necromancer Livia finally killed the last mursaat Lazarus under the gaze of the Eye of Janthir, attracted the attention of a self-titled Priest of Abaddon who made an effort to study and preserve knowledge of the fallen God of Secrets. Enigmatic Parables of the Gods were also discovered in the region around this time, revealing darker interpretations of the nature of the Six.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nExplorable zones\nCore Game\nStraits of Devastation (70–75)\nMalchor's Leap (75–80)\nCursed Shore (80)\nLiving World Season 3\nSiren's Landing (80)\nDungeons\nThe Ruined City of Arah (80)\n\n\n== Orr Explorer achievement ==\nThis achievement consists of discovering all 60 areas within Orr that were available when the game launched, and thereby excludes any of the areas within Siren's Landing as it was added during Living World Season 3. Some commonly missed areas are as follows:\n\nStraits of Devastation – Zho'qafa Catacombs; Sea of Elon\nCursed Shore – The Artesian Waters\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Concept art ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nOrr includes nearly twice the number of dynamic events as other regions.\nBefore the Megaserver update in the April 2014 Feature Pack, the status of the temple events of the three initial Orrian maps were tied to each world's server shards and affected all the respective world's Orrian maps and statues of the gods linked to the temples. For example, successfully securing the Cathedral of Glorious Victory in the Temple of Balthazar meta event would remove the harmful effects of the corrupted statues of Balthazar not only in the Straits of Devastation but also in Malchor's Leap and Cursed Shore zones. Following the Megaserver update, the cross-map mechanics of the temples have been disabled, and the harmful effects of the corrupted god statues become active only when the nearest temple is contested.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nAccording to Jeff Grubb, \"it is possible that the cryptic message in The Path to Revelations refers to the Dragons—a land unwaking could refer to the risen kingdom of Orr and answers to the origin of the dragons do lie there.\"\nInternally at ArenaNet, this area was known as \"Risen.\"\nDuring early development, there were one or two more Orr maps planned.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "strName": "Kryta",
      "strWikiText": "Kryta () is a region located between the Shiverpeak Mountains and Maguuma Jungle. The name Kryta is used to refer to both the geological location and the last human kingdom in Tyria, which once spanned the entire geographical region until about roughly 1219 AE. The kingdom is ruled by Queen Jennah, one of the last two known surviving descendants of King Doric, from the grand city of Divinity's Reach. The bountiful fields and plains of Kryta are now the home of all humans, once the predominant race of Tyria. The parts of Kryta not ruled by humans are either property of the Free City of Lion's Arch or are contested in the ongoing Centaur War.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe kingdom of Kryta was originally established before the Exodus of the Gods by King Mazdak, a prince of Orr. After three centuries of independent rule after the Exodus, it was colonized by Elona in 300 AE. Kryta regained independence from Elona in 358 AE, just a few decades after being colonized, making it the youngest of all human kingdoms for still unknown reasons around the time when the Centaur War began. Although the history of the kingdom is not known from its independence through the end of the first two of the Guild Wars that were fought between Kryta and Ascalon, Ascalon emerged as the victor of at least the second of the wars, which ended around 1020 AE.\nThe greatest change in the course of history of Kryta occurred after the end of the third Guild Wars, during the Charr Invasion of the northern human kingdoms of Ascalon, Kryta and Orr. With the guidance of Saul D'Alessio and his unseen gods, Kryta was the only human kingdom to prevail against the Charr. During the invasion, King Jadon fled the throne, bringing about the rule of the White Mantle which lasted some seven years before resulting in a civil war. This war was ended by Jadon's daughter Salma's rightful ascension to the throne in 1079 AE. The White Mantle and their gods, who had become a tyrannical and oppressive cult during their reign, were cast out, though not completely eradicated. A short golden age ensued, and many Krytans remember Salma as Queen Salma the Good.\nIn 1219 AE, the Elder Dragon Zhaitan awoke, raising the peninsula of Orr from the sea and causing a great flood that destroyed the city of Lion's Arch and other shoreline towns and ports. Both the people of Kryta and the royal family moved north to Divinity Coast, where Divinity's Reach, an even grander city than the previous capital, was built. After the flood receded, Lion's Arch was rebuilt by Cobiah Marriner as a free city open to all races and cultures and a bastion against the Dead Ships of the Risen.\nSince then, the influence of humans in the whole region has diminished considerably during the last century. Many former territories, including the city of Lion's Arch, the monastery island of Sanctum Cay, and provinces by the Ullen River, are no longer ruled by humans; instead, they are claimed by pirates, the immigrant tengu, and Maguuman wildlife respectively. Many of the islands in the Sea of Sorrows, once considered to be part of kingdom of Kryta, are now inhabited by various creatures and no longer part of any major governance.\nToday, Kryta is a cultural melting pot, housing human refugees from all over Tyria. Ascalonians, Canthans, Elonians and even Orrians call this place home. Laws are designed by the Ministry, and citizens of all nationalities are given a voice in Krytan politics due to humans long since putting aside their different heritages in uniting against the threat of the Elder Dragons. The Seraph represent law and order in Kryta, while the Shining Blade serve as the royal family's elite guard, as they have served at the side of the monarchy since they put Queen Salma on the throne two and a half centuries ago during the Krytan civil war. They have their work cut out for them, however, as the White Mantle conspire in secret to return to power, while centaurs roam the land, fighting for their former territory. Politically, Kryta is a land of unrest. The Ministry is split between those at odds with Queen Jennah and those favoring her, leaving political factions to tear Divinity's Reach apart from within – all the while the centaurs, bandits, and the minions of the Elder Dragons creep ever closer to the heart of the last human kingdom.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nCities\nDivinity's Reach\nLion's Arch\nExplorable zones\nCore Game\nQueensdale (1–17)\nKessex Hills (15–25)\nGendarran Fields (25–35)\nHarathi Hinterlands (35–45)\nBloodtide Coast (45-55)\nLiving World Season 1\nSouthsun Cove (80)\nLiving World Season 3\nLake Doric (80)\nDungeons\nCaudecus's Manor (40, 45)\n\n\n== Krytan Explorer achievement ==\nThis achievement consists of discovering all 175 areas within Kryta that were available when the game launched.

      "strWikiText": "The Crystal Desert is the land that lies between the nations of Ascalon, Orr, and Elona. It is said that every grain of sand in the desert was in fact a tiny crystal, giving the region its name. The southern reaches of the Crystal Desert is full of sulfurous wastes, called the Desolation, once so toxic from Abaddon's influence that only the dead and demonic could pass. The Crystal Desert is famous for many legendary landmarks, including Glint's lair in the north and Augury Rock where Ascension was possible. At least two portals into the Mists were formed in the desert: one in the Tomb of the Primeval Kings leading to the Hall of Heroes, and another at the Mouth of Torment leading to the Realm of Torment.\nOver the past millennia, many nations had tried to settle these lands, each one eventually succumbing to the sands. In modern day, the lich king Palawa Joko has extended the borders of Elona to the southern reaches of the Crystal Desert while the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik has branded the eastern portions. To the northern of the desert, defectors from Joko's empire have established new homes along the Bay of Elon and the highlands connected to the Shiverpeak Mountains.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nThe Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire expansion is required to access this region.\nActivate the Path of Fire story in your Story Journal in the hero panel, and finish the first part of the Sparking the Flame (Prologue) story step to gain access to the next instance marker on the airship docked near the Phoenix Roost lighthouse in Lion's Arch which will then transport you to the Crystal Oasis.\nAfter finishing Sparking the Flame (Prologue) on a character, that character may speak to the Lionguard Aircrew (Transport Facilitator) to enter the Crystal Desert again.\nAlternatively, if your guild has the Windswept Haven guild hall you can enter your guild hall via the guild panel and then walk through the exit portal to reach the Domain of Vabbi.\nSpearmarshal's Plea can be used to teleport to the Domain of Vabbi.\nThe Thousand Seas Pavilion, accessed by purchasing a Gem Store pass, can be used to teleport to several maps, too, via the Portals to Tyria.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nExplorable zones\nPath of Fire\nCrystal Oasis\nDesert Highlands\nDomain of Vabbi\nElon Riverlands\nThe Desolation\nLiving World Season 4\nDomain of Istan\nDomain of Kourna\nDragonfall\nJahai Bluffs\nSandswept Isles\nGuild halls\nWindswept Haven\nInstances\nSun's Refuge\nRaids\nMythwright Gambit\nThe Key of Ahdashim\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nOver a thousand years ago, much of the desert was known as the Crystal Sea, though there are mentions of a desert in those times. Back then, what is now the Desolation was once a verdant coastline, and its only inhabitants were the Forgotten who served the dragon Glint. When humanity was still new to Tyria, the sea-faring humans known as Margonites thrived in these waters and in the Unending Ocean. 250 years ago, discoveries were made that some historians believed pointed to a Luxon presence in the Crystal Desert more than a thousand years ago, but just as many believed this to be a misinterpretation of the evidence. It's worth noting that the existence of Margonites was also doubted by some historians of the time, who viewed them as mythological.\nWhen the magic gifted by their patron god Abaddon was revoked by the other five gods, the Margonites defaced statues of the five gods in the Temple of the Six and turned their boats into towers attempting to physically reach Ascension to join their god, but all this did was incite a conflict between them and the Forgotten faithful to the Six Gods. This sparked into a war between Abaddon and the five gods themselves, eventually leading to Abaddon's defeat and imprisonment in the Realm of Torment, the creation of the Desolation, and the drying of the sea and turning the lands inhospitable to most races. Following this, the gods left in an event now called the Exodus of the Gods.\nOver the following centuries, many groups made pilgrimages to the region, following the footsteps of the Margonites in attempting Ascension or other knowledge and hopes. Among them were the Primeval Kings who established many tombs in the region during their reign, Lord Kree who commanded an army of beasts, mysterious Seekers who searched for a new home, the colony established by Turai Ossa, and Ascalonians[citation needed] who built towering statues of themselves.\nTurai's colony fell to internal strife sparked by the three priests who held the Vision Crystal created to gather the gaze of the gods to them. During this civil war, the Elonians created a powerful weapon that wiped out at least one of the few cities they established, and also warred against the local Forgotten, who they had mistaken as mindless beasts of the desert like the local hydras or scarabs. How the Seekers and Ascalonians perished is unknown; all that is known is that they were there and they died. The only group to have managed to \"survive\" the desert in this millennia were the Awakened undead of Palawa Joko who took their home in the Desolation, but he too fell when he warred against Elona and was defeated by Turai Ossa in the Battle of Jahai.\n\n\n=== Conflicts in the desert ===\nIn the year 1072 AE, the Chosen foretold in Glint's Flameseeker Prophecies arrived in the desert, driven from Kryta by the White Mantle. With the aid of the restless spirits of Turai Ossa's fallen pilgrimage, they were the first to succeed in Ascending, and gained the Gift of True Sight that would allow them to fight the mursaat. With this act, the souls of the Elonians were finally able to move on to the afterlife, and Turai took his place in the Hall of Heroes. Nightfall came in 1075 AE, and Abaddon's return began to twist the southern reaches of the desert into a nightmarish land, worse than it was before, and saw the return of Palawa Joko to regain control of his former lands. Abaddon was ultimately defeated at the end of the conflict, and peace returned to the Crystal Desert for a time.\nAround 1135 AE, Palawa Joko launched a new invasion into Elona, which was victorious. During this invasion, he dammed and redirected the Elon River from north of Vabbi to make it flow into the Sea of Sorrows. This flooded the desert just north of the sulfurous Desolation, turning its nearby area into a green and growing verdant oasis. Joko's victory over Elona, and spreading further north, prompted Tyrians to lock down travel into the desert though they still took the refugees that fled Joko's empire until they stopped coming nearly 150 years later. Despite this lockdown, the Order of Whispers remained in contact with Elona, and the Durmand Priory made a few expeditions into the desert although they did not produce any updated maps on the region.\nAfter the Elder Death Dragon Zhaitan rose from underneath Orr and made the sunken nation rise as well, the northern edge of Elona's borders in the desert became a warzone between the Risen and Joko's forces while the resulting tsunami flooded the coastline reaching all the way down to Atholma in Dajkah.\nPalawa Joko continued strengthening his rule and either exterminated the few remaining Sunspears or persuaded them to join his forces as living or undead thralls. Some Sunspears persisted, however, despite being constantly hunted by their turned brethren, the Mordant Crescent. A few of the spirits who had originally moved on, such as Turai Ossa, reappeared in the Crystal Desert to guide their fellow spirits and adventurers.\n\n\n=== Edge of Destiny ===\nIn 1320 AE, the guild Destiny's Edge sought out Glint's Lair in the Desert Highlands so they could battle Glint as they believed her to be a champion preparing for her master Kralkatorrik's awakening. After locating the lair and battling Glint, they came to realize that they were not enemies as Glint, just like Destiny's Edge, had sworn to oppose the Elder Dragons.\nDeciding to pool their resources together, they fought Kralkatorrik together by the time the Crystal Dragon had flown to Glint's lair to punish her for her betrayal. Although Glint and the asura Snaff were able to force Kralkatorrik on the ground, the rest of the guild were unable to injure the Elder Dragon in time with the Dragonsblood Spear before Kralkatorrik took off. Both Glint and Snaff perished in the attempt while a large area around the lair was corrupted into the Dragonbrand as a result, and Destiny's Edge fell apart soon after as the grieving guild members blamed one another for the failure.\n\n\n=== Interim years ===\nGlint's Zephyrite allies traveled to the location of her demise some time in late 1320 AE in an attempt to prevent her corpse and the magic within from falling into the wrong hands. Harnessing Glint's magic, the Zephyrites were able to use the aspects of Lightning, Sun and Wind to improve their movement skills and build an improved version of an airship which they dubbed the Zephyr Sanctum.\nThe spreading Dragonbrand and the invasion of Kralkatorrik's Branded minions caused the passage between the Desert Highlands and the Stronghold of Ebonhawke to collapse, preventing travel between the two regions. Vlast, Glint's first scion, culled the Branded to honor his fallen mother. Glint's surviving Forgotten allies, led by Josso Essher, attempted a cleansing ritual to purify Kralkatorrik from his corruption, but their attempt was unsuccessful as the Elder Dragon ended up corrupting the remaining Forgotten into Branded instead.\n\n\n=== Living World Season 2 ===\nSome time after the Bazaar of the Four Winds in 1326 AE, the Zephyrites used their Zephyr Sanctum to travel to distant locations, including the Desert Highlands. While there, the Master of Peace obtained the last of Glint's eggs from an unknown individual who tasked the Master to guard the egg with his life.\n\n\n=== Path of Fire ===\n\nIncreased levels of ambient magic through ley lines and deaths of the Elder Dragons Zhaitan and Mordremoth caused some inhabitants of the desert to absorb too much of the magic and turn insane and violent. The Order of Shadows placed bounties on these threats to protect settlements and travelers.\nIn 1330 AE, one of the Six Gods had returned. Balthazar, the God of Fire and War, made his way into the Crystal Desert to kill Kralkatorrik and take the Elder Dragon's magic for himself. Balthazar's temporary alliance with Palawa Joko led to the creation of the Forged which the rogue god would use in his campaign. However, Balthazar later betraying and imprisoning Joko in the Domain of the Lost left the Awakened and the Mordant Crescent without their leader, forcing the viziers and clanmarshals to make do and rule the best they could while dealing with the invading Forged and waiting for the return of their missing king.\nKralkatorrik's flight further south to Vabbi extended the Dragonbrand and decimated much of the Vabbian countryside. A crucial battle was fought at Kodash Bazaar between the Awakened, Branded and Forged. The battle ended with the death of Balthazar and the empowering of both Glint's scion Aurene and Kralkatorrik, leaving the future of the Crystal Desert and Elona uncertain. A small glimmer of hope came with the revitalization of the Sunspears whose surviving members joined forces with the griffons of the Sunspear Sanctuary with the support of Tahlkora and the Pact Commander in an effort to resist Joko's tyranny.\n\n\n=== Living World Season 4 ===\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\nThis widget requires Javascript to function.

The large volcano at the center of the ring, called Abaddon's Mouth, is where the Six Gods dropped the Bloodstones before leaving Tyria for good in Year 0. A few hundred years later, the volcano erupted and sent the five Bloodstones into different direction across Central Tyria, one of them landing back in the caldera. The island has remained active ever since.\nAt the caldera of Abaddon's Mouth, not far from the Bloodstone, lies the Door of Komalie, which leads to the Realm of Torment. The landscape of the islands is dark and jagged, with the lava solidifying into monstrous skulls and other shapes due to malevolent energies across the islands, which is most likely the presence of the Realm of Torment seeping through the Door of Komalie. Ships that pass by the Ring report hearing the tell-tale hiss of scalding hot lava hitting the ocean, instantly vaporizing the saltwater into steam.\nThe reefs off the islands are formed of black pumice stone. There are very few natural ports, and those that might be suitable for docking would bring the crew of the ship within danger of being caught by a sudden, unexpected eruption. There are also a series of mursaat ruins, including the infamous Onyx Gate, that remains untouched since the days of the Flameseeker Prophecies.\nThere are no longer any known settlements in the Ring of Fire since the mursaat were nearly wiped out by the Chosen and titans, and the islands were left dramatically reshaped by the Rising of Orr, leaving question to how many mursaat ruins and ports remained.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nExplorable zones\nDraconis Mons\nEmber Bay (Lore-wise)\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nEmber Bay is mechanically part of the Heart of Maguuma region, so viewing vistas and gathering nodes in Ember Bay count as Heart of Maguuma dailies.\n\n\n== Related achievements ==\n Fishing: Ring of Fire Fisher — Collect 14 different fish from the waterways around the Ring of Fire.

      "strWikiText": "Cantha is an old land, and one that has been occupied by humans from their first days. In fact, the northern coastline of Cantha is the earliest known location of human settlements. Although Cantha has its own history, over the years it has suffered from the Jade Wind event, internal wars, criminals, isolation and the Great Tsunami. Despite this, Cantha has stood firm and today is a prosperous place with a strong empire.\nCantha has mostly been ruled by a single empire, called the Empire of the Dragon (or alternatively, the Dragon Empire or the Empire of Cantha). Empress Ihn, a direct descendant of the empire's founder, Kaineng Tah, still rules the continent today.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nThe Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons expansion is required to access this region.\nActivate the End of Dragons story in your Story Journal in the hero panel, and finish the Old Friends story step to gain access to Seitung Province.\nAlternatively, if your guild has the Isle of Reflection guild hall you can enter your guild hall via the guild panel and then walk through the exit portal.\nIf you have obtained the Arborstone Portal Scroll while playing the story with a character, alternate characters at level 80 can use the item to teleport to Arborstone and then, just like before, simply have to walk through one of the exit portals.\nThe Thousand Seas Pavilion, accessed by purchasing a Gem Store pass, can be used to teleport to all 4 Cantha maps, too, via the Portals to Tyria.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nCities\nArborstone\nExplorable zones\nEnd of Dragons\nSeitung Province\nNew Kaineng City\nThe Echovald Wilds\nDragon's End\nGuild halls\nIsle of Reflection\nLounges\nThousand Seas Pavilion\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: An Empire Divided: A Selected History of Mysterious Cantha for the Traveling Scholar\n\n\n=== Origins of the continent ===\n\n\n=== Pre-imperial era ===\n\nThe time before the founding of the Empire of the Dragon is referred to by humans as the pre-imperial era, which is further divided into loosely defined early, middle and late pre-imperial eras. This is because the Canthan calendar lacks the precise means of recording dates before 0 CC, which corresponds with 510 BE in Tyria's Mouvelian calendar.\nDragons of all shapes, sizes, and origin have called Cantha home for thousands of years, since long before the human tribes of old arrived on the continent and joined to form the empire that took dragons as its symbol. Despite this, in contrast to the northern continent of Tyria, the extent to which Canthan prehistory had been shaped by the Elder Dragons remained unknown to scholars who chronicled Cantha's early history, except that the early pre-imperial era would later be mentioned in the context of Central Tyrian research about the cyclic nature of Elder Dragon awakenings once modern Tyrians became aware of the Elder Dragons' existence and their actions during previous dragonrises.\nLater scholars have presented a hypothesis that Canthan humans may have known about the Elder Dragon of Water since the Dragon Empire's founding because dragon iconography and reverence has appeared in Canthan historical records for thousands of years and because there have been illustrations and descriptions of statues far grander in scale than the saltspray dragons that Canthans were more familiar with. According to this hypothesis, the friendlier naga of the era, well versed with ancient history among their people, may have spun stories about the Elder Dragon to early human settlers if they knew of her existence in some manner.\nIn terms of the \"elder races\" (that is, races that were around at the time of the last dragonrise), there is evidence of a Forgotten presence in Cantha, as well as relics of a mysterious race speculated to be an offshoot of the Deldrimor dwarves, dating back to before humanity's arrival in the world of Tyria. The buildings of the Altrumm Ruins in the Echovald Forest also serve as evidence of a pre-human civilisation in Cantha, but their architects are unknown.\nIn 786 BE, the Six Human Gods first appeared in Cantha, bringing humanity with them. The Luxon and Kurzick tribes did not emerge from the Canthan people and arrived separately at a later time, in unclear circumstances, as did the human tribes of the northern continents of Elona and Tyria. Cantha has been said to have been settled by humans multiple times in the pre-imperial era, suggesting that the tribes that would one day become known as modern Canthans were only the latest colonizers of this fertile land.\n\n\n=== Age of the Marmoset (510 BE–205 BE / 0–305 CC) ===\nIn 510 BE, the Canthan tribes united under a single leader, the warlord Kaing, and established the Empire of the Dragon while marking the historic date with year 0 in the Canthan calendar. Kaing took the mantle of emperor as Kaineng Tah and founded the Imperial Family lineage. He ordered the construction of Raisu Palace as his seat of power in the same year. Kaineng Tah was said to have fathered over two hundred sons and daughters both with his wife and thirty favored concubines. This meant that although the throne had not always passed directly from father to son over the centuries to come, it had always gone to one of royal blood—at most, a first cousin as seen in several well-documented cases. The first emperor died under mysterious circumstances in 46 CC (464 BE) while riding his favorite horse on a hunting expedition. Although official history describes Kaineng Tah's death as purely accidental due to him falling off the spooked horse, fragmentary records have mentioned unexplained wounds on his usually trusty and well-trained horse's rump and on the emperor himself with a few records even suggesting some involvement from his fellow huntsmen.\nIt is unknown whether Kaineng Tah left a will behind to declare his eventual successor although contemporary writings by the emperor himself indicated that the document might have existed at some point. However, no will was ever officially discovered, leading to later scholarly speculation that the will might have been destroyed. The throne passed on to the older of Kaineng Tah's two sons, Yian Zho. The new emperor's two elder sisters were neither consulted nor welcome in the succeeding government. The sisters' fates remain unknown, but they vanished from the record weeks after Yian Zho had taken the mantle of emperor.\nDuring Yian's reign, the Luxon and Kurzick tribes united into two nations and seceded from the empire, only to be forced back with military might and diplomacy as vassal states as Yian Zho's army was unable to fully annex the two tribes' territories. This time was also the birth of the hostility between the Luxons and Kurzicks that would remain for over a thousand years. After Yian Zho's reign, Cantha remained fairly isolated in the south, only opening trade with the northern continents centuries later in 731 CC (221 AE), when resources became low for their growing population.\n\n\n=== Age of the Falcon (205 BE–1 AE / 305–510 CC) ===\nThe Age of the Falcon, which spanned from 305 CC (205 BE) (the year that humans first appeared on the northern continent of Tyria) to the Exodus of the Gods, was an age of isolationism. By this time, the Empire of the Dragon was already sprawling, and had little impact on the development of the Kingdom of Tyria (which would, after the Exodus, fragment into the kingdoms of Ascalon, Kryta, and Orr). This era also marks the granting of the gift of magic to the mortal races of Tyria, including humans in Cantha (whose ritualists already had something which they called \"magic\", but was actually power granted to them by ancestor spirits).\n\n\n=== Age of the Bat (1–221 AE / 511–731 CC) ===\nThe gift and subsequent partial revocation of magic caused the widespread practice of the heroic professions, including in Cantha. Chanang, the eldest prince of the imperial line, defied the wishes of his father and chose to follow the hero's path. He became a warrior/monk and an ascendant. Upon succession as the eleventh emperor, he refused the title of \"lord emperor\" and became the first \"ascendant emperor\" as Chang Hai. Since then, all emperors have been required by family tradition to practice at least two of the heroic professions.\n\n\n=== Age of the Hedgehog (221–694 AE / 731–1203 CC) ===\n731 CC (221 AE) marked the first formal contact between the Empire of the Dragon and the kingdoms of Tyria. Cantha provided valuable knowledge and technology to the less advanced kingdoms, and in return received badly-needed resources. This allowed the recovery of Shing Jea Island, which had been damaged by overlogging, to begin, eventually transforming it into pastoral agricultural land.\n\n\n=== Age of the Tortoise (694–872 AE / 1204–1382 CC) ===\nThe Age of the Tortoise began with the death of the tyrannical Singtah, the 23rd emperor, and the burning of the first Raisu Palace. It continued with his son Emperor Senvho's reconstruction of the palace, a task which obsessed him and consumed him for the remainder of his eighty-year reign.\n\n\n=== Age of the Dragon (872 AE–? / 1382 CC–?) ===\n\n\n==== The Jade Wind ====\n\nThe Jade Wind was a formative event in Canthan history. It occurred when the bodyguard Shiro Tagachi assassinated his master, the 26th emperor of Cantha, Angsiyan. Shiro was a formidable warrior in his own right, but he also performed a number of dark rituals in preparation for his actions.\nShiro did not live long after committing the murder. Three of the emperor's guard, the Luxon spear master Archemorus, the Kurzick Saint Viktor, and the assassin Vizu, attacked him. In a climactic battle, Archemorus and Viktor were able to wrestle Shiro's swords from him and, turning them against their wielder, nearly slice him in two. In Shiro's final moments, he called upon dark powers and sucked out the fallen emperor's very soul. Tagachi's death cry released the foulest of magic, a horrific wail that rose like a gale over the land. This Jade Wind spread from the temple, turning the sea into solid jade and petrifying everything it touched (trees, animals, and people) within the Echovald Forest.\nThe newly crowned emperor, the late Angsiyan's son Hanjai, took the throne while the empire was on the verge of collapse due to the aftermath of the Jade Wind. Tales tell how Hanjai prayed to the ancients for guidance, to seek a way to reunite his people and restore glory to the troubled lands. His prayers were answered in the form of a mighty celestial dragon that swooped from the heavens and assured him that Cantha would rise once more. The inspired Hanjai poured every ounce of his blood, sweat, and tears into achieving that goal by bringing Canthans together via offering refugees a place to stay in within Kaineng City, making the land as safe as he could in the aftermath of the Jade Wind, and restoring leadership.\nThe next summer, Hanjai instituted the Dragon Festival. It was meant to commemorate those who had lost their lives in the Jade Wind, unite all denizens of the empire, and celebrate the establishment of a community on Shing Jea Island. It also symbolised the survival of the Empire of the Dragon in the face of calamity. The emperor and his subjects would bow their heads in respect as they prayed for the blessings of the Celestial Dragon while invoking its name.\nAt some point, this celestial dragon spirit—potentially the Cardinal Celestial Tahmu or the Celestial Dragon—became regarded as the figurehead of the empire.\n\n\n==== Tengu Wars and division in Cantha ====\nIn 880 AE, tension rose between the people of Cantha and the tengu as Canthan farmers began settling Shing Jea Island. At first, it was a simple matter of territory and the fighting was kept to a few skirmishes. War nearly broke out when the Sensali clan of tengu massacred an entire village and, according to reports at the time, consumed the bodies of those killed. While Emperor Hanjai's ambassador was able to avoid open war with the Angchu clan of tengu, the Sensali clan declared the Angchu traitors and continued their acts of aggression.\nCantha's trade agreements with Ascalon, Elona and Orr stood until 902 AE, when they were dissolved by Emperor Hanjai, beginning one of the the most isolated period in the empire's history. \nIn 1017 AE, the Luxons and Kurzicks ceased regular diplomatic contact, communicating with each other only through liaisons of the Celestial Ministry when absolutely necessary. For many years to come, they would remain more focused on their divisions than on the problems that damaged their lands from within.\nKintah, the 27th emperor, was known as a man of the people. He informally reopened trade between Cantha and the Tyrian and Elonian kingdoms in 1022 AE when Loremaster Ermenred of Ascalon was able to negotiate a visit to the continent and Shing Jea Island to tour with Cantha's new emperor.\nContinued settlement of Shing Jea under Kintah's successor Kisu since his ascension to the throne in 1058 AE led to the Canthan farmers passing on diseases to the tengu and their hatchlings. Being forced to kill their young and their brethren, the tengu sought revenge and escalated their acts of aggression.\nIn 1071 AE, Wona, the emperor's minister of war who had fought against the tengu for many years, contacted the tengu chieftains Swift Honorclaw and Gull Hookbeak of the Angchu and the Sensali clans and requested their presence for a summit to negotiate peace between humans and tengu. Emperor Kisu asked his half-brother, Master Togo, to accompany a delegation to the war minister's estate as an observer of the proceedings and to legitimize the talks. However, the summit was a trap by Wona who intended to kill Togo and pin the blame on the tengu, creating the pretext for a genocide.\nTogo was able to rally the remaining human delegates behind him to stop Wona's plans while promising the tengu to bring back the war minister's head as proof that the emperor was not behind the plot. The tengu leaders sent Talon Silverwing with Togo to find the minister and kill Togo if he proved to be deceitful. Togo turned out to be a man of his word, however, and killed Wona after fighting through the minister's defenders. While the Sensali left the summit in distrust and retreated to their raiding ways, the more civilized Angchu seized the opportunity for a real truce. Togo brought the tengu's complaints to Emperor Kisu and hammered home a peace treaty after 191 years of hostility, becoming a respected figure among the Angchu.\nOne year after the Tengu Wars had officially ended, the humans and the tengu began holding an annual festival at Shing Jea Monastery to celebrate the anniversary of the peace accords. This festival became known as the Day of the Tengu and was attended by Emperor Kisu himself who held a speech to the festive crowd.\n\n\n==== Return of the Betrayer ====\n\nSee also: Storyline of Guild Wars Factions\nTwo hundred years after the Jade Wind, events occurred that revealed Shiro Tagachi's evil was not fully destroyed. The heroes of Tyria joined forces with Emperor Kisu, his half-brother Master Togo, and Togo's former student Brother Mhenlo.\nThe journey began with the appearance of a horrible plague, which turned the victims of the disease into violent creatures, called the Afflicted. After researching the disease, the group found evidence of Shiro Tagachi, a man long dead. However, beings from the afterlife, called envoys, told them that Shiro was turned into a sprit. The envoys' task, as penance for crimes committed in life, was to guide the souls of the dead. Instead, Shiro was corrupting the spirits, merging them with magical constructs called the Shiro'ken and building an army.\nThe group attempted to destroy Shiro, but were unsuccessful. They needed allies. Emperor Kisu was easy to convince, the Oracle of the Mists, Suun, also contributed valuable knowledge. After several negotiations, they convinced the Canthan vassal states of Luxon and Kurzick to join them. The dragon Kuunavang taught them valuable skills and agreed to fight alongside them.\nFinally, the group ascertained Shiro's final goal. He was trying to return to life, and he only needed one more thing: to spill the blood of a member of the imperial bloodline. Togo, Mhenlo, and the heroes wasted no time in returning to the palace, but they only arrived at the last second. Battling their way through the Shiro'ken, the group reached the Imperial Sanctum to find Shiro standing over Emperor Kisu, about to give the final strike. Master Togo, in a desperate act, rushed to his half-brother, taking the blow. The emperor was saved, but Togo sacrificed himself—and Shiro, with his quest now complete, had achieved his goal. The betrayer left to complete his spell, leaving the survivors behind to mourn a great man.\nIn attempt to avenge his teacher, Mhenlo rushed into the Imperial Sanctum to confront Shiro, and the group followed him. They found Shiro Tagachi fully restored, a deadly and formidable assassin—but once again, a mortal one. A terrible battle ensued, but the party was able to bring down Shiro. As Shiro lay dying, the Oracle Suun appeared, using his power to encase Shiro's body in solid jade. The envoys also arrived, seeking Shiro's soul. The last remnants of Shiro Tagachi were consigned to a special place in the Underworld, where his spirit was imprisoned and forced to answer for his many crimes.\n\n\n==== Winds of Change ====\nSee also: Storyline of Guild Wars Beyond\nThough the Betrayer was stopped, the plague persisted in Cantha. Countless lives were lost, from the families of people forced to live in the streets to prominent families like the Yuudachi, head of the Sai Ling Order. Ashu Yuudachi survived the slaughter under miraculous conditions, and came into the care of his aunt, Reiko Murakami.\nIn 1073 AE, Reiko, then a member of the Ministry of Flame, made her first strides toward rallying the people of Cantha to fight back against the Afflicted. With Ashu at her side as a symbol of hope, her message resonated with the people. Little by little, Canthans began to take their fate into their own hands. Reiko began to rise in the ranks of the Ministry of Flame, as she and Ashu became renowned public figures. They spoke more often with the people of Cantha, offering the promise of change and the hope for a better future, free of the Affliction. Over the next couple of years, Reiko would become increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the Ministry of Flame. Finding flaws in the system—the needless bureaucracy, political maneuverings, and personal agendas—she came to the conclusion that something greater needed to happen if Cantha was ever going to be able to move forward.\nIn 1077 AE, Reiko officially established the Ministry of Purity, with Ashu as a central figure. The Ministry of Purity made dealing with that which harmed Cantha its goal: to take action when all other branches of the government were content to turn a blind eye, pass the issues off as the emperor's problem, or fault the other ministries. Two years later, the Ministry of Purity began in earnest its campaign to finally rid Cantha of the Afflicted. Brave men and women rallied to their cause, eager to make their homes safe once more. In the course of the campaign, which lasted under a year, the Afflicted were vanquished alongside many members from the Jade Brotherhood and Am Fah gangs, and the tengu were branded as traitors and routed. The Ministry then set its sights on sweeping social reform.\nIn 1080 AE, Reiko's ambitions were exposed, and word was sent to Emperor Kisu about her attempts to eradicate the tengu and oppress any Canthan who stood in her way. However, Kisu was unable to act against the Ministry of Purity, whose influence was growing beyond his control, out of worry that divided loyalties between their respective followers would lead to an endless civil war. Reiko was eventually assassinated by her niece Miku Yuudachi and the Hero of Tyria who were assisted by discontent Shing Jea peasants led by Xin Ji, Angchu tengu led by Soar Honorclaw, survivors from Am Fah and the Jade Brotherhood led by Daisuke Crimson Edge and Eri, Heart of Fire, and even the atoning Ministry initiate Zei Ri. They believed that Reiko and the ministry, in their zealotry to fight evil, had become a threat to themselves and to others with the way they violently oppressed those that did not fit their ideal of a purified Cantha. Miku believed that she was rescuing her brother Ashu from Reiko's grip; however, Ashu refused his sister's protection after Reiko's death and took control of the Ministry of Purity, pledging to show the people of Cantha the correct path to walk and to make Cantha whole again while claiming to not repeat Reiko's mistakes. Those participating in the uprising against Reiko lamented that many Canthans would mourn Reiko's passing despite her crimes and would view the Hero as a criminal.\n\n\n=== Contact lost with the other continents ===\nSee also: The Movement of the World\nBy 1127 AE, the people of Tyria were on their own. The new Canthan emperor, Usoku, finally unified his continent into the Empire of the Dragon. His armies conquered the vassal states of Kurzick and Luxon, making his power absolute. These efforts were supported by the Ministry of Purity, which had originally been established by Reiko Murakami to combat the Afflicted. Usoku began to purge the lands of rebels, the sick, and any non-humans, including the tengu who were forced to flee north to Elona and Tyria before many tengu tribes from Cantha, Elona and Tyria eventually built a new sanctuary called the Dominion of Winds for their persecuted clans. It was not long after the purges that Canthan embassies started to follow Usoku's isolationist policies. Regardless of this isolation, the Empire of the Dragon continued to do trade with Krytan royalty by trading Canthan silk and other goods for Krytan cotton.\nThe Rising of Orr, caused by the awakening of the Elder Dragon Zhaitan in 1219 AE, completed Cantha's isolationism as the southern seas became dangerous to travel for sailors due to the increasing menace of Zhaitan's Risen minions patrolling the waters on black ships around Orr. Due to this blockage, the last contact had was from the Canthan tengu who, led by a descendant of Talon Silverwing, forced their way through the Risen forces. Usoku became the last Canthan emperor whose name Tyrian scholars knew.\nLater, Emperor Kyobok and his wife Empress Ha Rin met at Raisu Palace when Orr's revival resulted in a great tsunami that struck Cantha in 1729 CC. The emperor and most of his family, along with the royal guard and servants, were at the Raisu Palace at the time and witnessed the flooding of Old Kaineng City firsthand. Kurzick ambassadors Asmund zu Heltzer and Eira zu Heltzer were also in the palace, presumably as prisoners. Witnessing the impending catastrophe, Kuunavang sought help from the Elder Dragon Soo-Won as no one else had the power to stop the great tide. Soo-Won arrived in Cantha and used her power over water to create another great wave to counter the effect of the tsunami, saving Cantha. Soo-Won earned the status of a legendary hero with the deed although both she and Kuunavang disappeared soon after.\nIn the century that followed, occasional sporadic Canthan sailors would wash ashore along the Maguuma Jungle, being the only proof Tyrians had that Cantha still existed. Despite this, Cantha's influence continued to affect humans in Central Tyria up to the present day as many families of Canthan origin settled there. Divinity's Reach, capital of the kingdom of Kryta, dedicated an entire city district to refugees and immigrants from Cantha, until the district was destroyed in the Great Collapse in 1325 AE.\n\n\n=== Interim years ===\nInspired by the Pact's victory over Zhaitan in 1325 AE, Captain Hao Luen of the Captain's Council reimagined Tyria's version of the Canthan Dragon Festival as Dragon Bash, a festival to celebrate the defeat of the Elder Dragons, in Lion's Arch in the same year. After the Great Collapse had been turned into the Crown Pavilion, Divinity's Reach had activities centering around Lunar New Year to celebrate the Canthan new year.\nDespite Cantha remaining inaccessible to the common Tyrian and Elonian, it is hinted that the Zephyrites managed to reach Cantha aboard their floating Zephyr Sanctum and traded with the locals as recently as 1327 AE.\nIn 1331 AE, the asura scholar Taimi reaffirmed the cases of Canthan sailors washing ashore, furthering that they had recounted tales of strange, and previously unknown, creatures emerging from the ocean. Taimi speculated the creatures from the tales to be connected to the deep sea dragon.\n\n\n=== End of Dragons ===\n\nCurrently Cantha begins to open up to the world, now that Empress Ihn will go to Kryta with Queen Jennah, make a treaty. During the time that Cantha remained isolated, the Ministry of Purity had a lot of relevance, much had changed in the Dragon Empire, although isolated it was able to prosper, even today they handle jade technology, thanks to Xunlai Jade.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nThe continent of Cantha is located south of the continent of Elona and the Battle Isles across the Unending Ocean. Cantha, the Dragon Empire contains seven distinct regions: Shing Jea Island, New Kaineng City, Echovald Forest and the Jade Sea, Drowned Kaineng, Kirin Peak, and the Great Turtle Highlands. The city of New Kaineng dominates the other regions known as a megalopolis.\nThe climate of Cantha is somewhat varied, it has wooded regions, and tropical zones, in the same way there are certain regions where there is snow.\n\n\n== List of regions ==\n\n\n=== Accessible regions ===\nShing Jea Island\nShing Jea Island is the largest of a chain of islands to the west of the northern tip of the Canthan mainland. It was shared between humans, the native tengu, yeti, and naga. \nThe Island contains important and historical sites, and is the main point of arrival in Cantha for foreign visitors.\nThe island is idyllic and rural, it is a place full of life and vegetation.\n\nNew Kaineng\nOriginally, the city of Kaineng was located in the northern part of the Cantha continent, but with the awakening of Zhaitan, the old city was destroyed by the tidal wave, and currently the new city of Kaineng changed its location.\nNew Kaineng City is now a modern metropolis with tall buildings and canals serving as skiff streets, residential areas, neighborhoods, laboratories, and part of old Kaineng. It is currently a center for jade technology provided by Xunlai Jade. Although within the same city there is a group of bandits such as the Jade Brotherhood that is dedicated to sabotaging and causing blackouts and the Purists who oppose the government of the Empress Ihn.\n\nThe Echovald Forest\nThe largest Forest in Cantha, Echovald Forest was the home of the Kurzicks before they were conquered by Emperor Usoku. When he struck the Jade Wind, the trees and wildlife were shot into stone, petrifying it.\nDuring the following years after Shiro Tagachi's defeat life began to sprout again, the damage caused by the Jade Wind has been reversing. However, in recent years it has begun to be threatened by contamination from the Xunlai Jade Junkyard.\n\nThe Jade Sea\nThe Jade Sea is an inland sea of Cantha with a greenish hue. Many centuries ago it was navigable to the ships of the Luxons and was a part of their home. When the Jade Wind caused by Shiro Tagachi was unleashed, all marine life along with the sea became petrified. During the years following Shiro Tagachi's defeat, the sea has begun to return to its watery state. \nAlthough in recent years with Soo-Won's magic, with the help of Joon and the Xunlai Jade some of Soo-Won's magic has been redirected into the sea to create what is now called Draconic Jade, which is a mineral that It is extracted to create technology and energy for the empire, although there are parts of the Jade Sea that have been drying up due to the same extraction.\n\n\n=== Inaccessible regions ===\nDrowned Kaineng\nIt was formerly the original city of Kaineng in Cantha. It was destroyed about 100 years ago by the awakening of the Elder Dragon Zhaitan. This is where the Raisu Palace was located where the emperors ruled the entire empire and it is also where the Tahnnakai Temple was where the statues of the greatest heroes of Cantha were and a temple dedicated to the Six Human Gods resided.\nThough the place is now riddled with Risen where danger lurks, there are still plenty of people who venture here, searching for history and lost treasures.\n\nGreat Turtle Highlands\nIt is an area north of the Jade Sea, it is a mountainous area.\n\nKirin Peak\nIt is an area south of Cantha\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Guild Wars Wiki has an article on Old Canthan.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs of 1072 AE, the worship and perception of the Five True Gods within the Empire of the Dragon had taken on a uniquely Canthan cast. The greater gods of the pantheon shared the Canthan heavens with an assortment of lesser demigods, as well as eternal ancestor spirits and legendary heroes granted divine status by the diverse inhabitants of the realm.\n\nDwayna is often depicted as young, tall, and slender, rising above the ground on huge feathered wings. Canthan artists often depicted her floating above the vibrant, living souls of their eternal ancestors.\nBalthazar is frequently shown holding a greatsword, its tip lodged in the ground, with a pair of battle hounds sitting at attention at his feet. In Cantha, the sword was usually one of the single-edged imperial style, and the battle hounds were usually replaced with winged drakes.\nStatues of Grenth depict the god with the body of a man and the narrow, skeletal head of a beast. Canthan artists tended to add a draconic look to the skull. The Canthan version of Grenth stood astride a small mountain of the dead, but in Canthan art the faces of these corpses were always averted from the god of death, as if in shame, to distinguish these enslaved dead from the \"living\" ancestor spirits.\nIn Cantha, Lyssa was not only the goddess of beauty and illusion, but also represented the incarnation of luck, both good and bad. Many Canthan assassins revered Lyssa more for her intrinsic duality than her famous beauty, and had been known to invoke her charms. Depictions of Lyssa in Canthan culture reflected the typical northern style: lithe twin figures of exquisite beauty entwined in an eternal dance.\nMelandru was frequently depicted in Cantha as a tall, winged dryad from the waist up. Canthan artists usually described a severe figure ensconced in an outcrop of Echovald quartz. Melandru's roadside temples offered shelter, food, and water to weary travelers even in Cantha, though such shrines were few, and separated by long stretches of lifeless stonescape.\nAfter the Ascension of Kormir in 1075 AE, Emperor Kisu decreed that the Dragon Festival, celebrating the Celestial Dragon, also be a commemoration of the great battle against Abaddon and Kormir's rise as the new Goddess of Truth.\nThere are no known Canthan depictions of Abaddon or Dhuum.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCanthan culture is diverse, largely separated into four styles: Kurzicks, Luxons, rural Canthan, and urban Canthan. There are some unified aspects, such as the Canthan calendar being based on a lunar system, as opposed to the solar system of the Mouvelian calendar, and as such celebrate a Lunar New Year. Similarly, all Canthans have a high reverence for the moon, which they dub \"Melandru's moon\".\nThe last known word of Cantha comes from the Zephyrites, who say that Cantha is one of their \"most culturally colorful ports of call,\" implying that Cantha's cultural side has only prospered in the following years.\nIn recent years, holodramas have started to gain popularity, including The Ministry Diaries, a series about Ministry workers and their erotic life.\n\nRural Canthan\nThe Canthan countryside is mostly left for farmland, and fishing, particularly on the island of Shing Jea, to feed the large and sprawling city of Kaineng.\nThe place has a District that serves as a residential area where the Ministry of Traffic is located and the Shing Jea Monastery houses the Royal Court that serves as a replacement for the Raisu Palace.\n\nUrban Canthan\nThe city is divided into two parts, which would be the part of the Old City of Kaineng that is flooded, in ruins and full of Risen, and the part of what is today the New Kaineng City that is composed of tall buildings and water channels that serve as streets through which they move and the use of zip Lines that serve to go up and down the buildings and be able to move. It has residential areas and places where poor people live, such as in the Grub Lane area.\nAnd it is where the headquarters of the Ministries of Cantha and Xunlai Jade are located.\nThis is also where a huge Jade Monument is located which is Soo-Won's monument, which was made as if to honor her for saving Cantha from the flood caused by the Zahitan Disaster.\n\nLuxons and Kurzicks\n\nThe Luxons and the Kurzicks were the two most populous and distinct vassal cultures of Cantha. During Emperor Usoku's reign, these two were killed, several escaped, and many more were united under the Empire.\nPrior to is the nation of the Kurzicks were led and directed by the Council of Nobles and their culture by the Great Houses: House zu Heltzer, House Vasburg, House Brauer, House Lutgardis, and House Durheim.\nThe Kurzicks were very religious people who took the worship of the Gods and their saints very seriously. The characteristics of the houses were based on the idea of ​​art, music and religion.\nFor their part, the Luxons were led and directed by the Council of Elders and their three clans: The Crab, The Serpent, and The Turtle.\nThey were nomads and before the Jade Wind they used to sail throughout the Jade Sea\nThe Luxons had their own demigoddesses known as the Three Queens: Alua, Elora, and Ione. Although they also worshiped the gods Balthazar, Grenth, and Lyssa, the former two were worshiped for their combative nature, and the latter was worshiped for the beauty of its architecture.\nAfter the annexation of these vassal states, all that remained were ruins and descendants that are now scattered.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nHistorically, while led by an emperor, the Empire of the Dragon has been managed by the Celestial Ministry, which is primarily made up of the Ministries of Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. After the return of Shiro Tagachi, a new ministry was formed, the Ministry of Purity, which quickly rose through the ranks of power as they gained the population's support through eradicating the Afflicted plague. \nDuring Emperor Usoku's rise to power, the Celestial Ministry continued to serve alongside the Ministry of Purity, which had greater power and influence. As time passed, Empress Haebaragi dissolved both the Heavenly Ministry and the Ministry of Purity to create the Ministries of Cantha. Each ministry has a function and serves a different task, such as the Ministry of Security that is dedicated to protecting and safeguarding people's lives, the Ministry of Archives that is dedicated to collecting history, the Ministry of Transit that grants travel permits for Traveling through Cantha, all of these ministries serve in conjunction with Empress Ihn, who is the current monarch of the Dragon Empire.\nThe Imperial Family of Cantha represents the longest known unbroken line of ancestral succession seen on the world of Tyria. Previously up to the reign of Empress Haebaragi, the Cantha Empire had always been ruled by the previous emperor's closest male relative, and the title of \"empress\" had been bestowed only through marriage and had little real power in the past. patriarchal society of Cantha.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nMaps\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nCitizens\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Empire of the Dragon, as of last contact, practiced agnatic primogeniture as its succession law, although there has been at least one Canthan empress (although not necessarily an Empress of Cantha). This seems to have changed in recent years with Empress Ihn.\nConcubinage was practiced in Cantha, by emperors from Kaineng Tah to Kintah.\nThe book Winds of Change found in the Durmand Hall suggests that Cantha has not been affected by the current dragonrise, at least prior to the rise of Zhaitan when contact was lost with Cantha.\nA group of dredge once tunnelled to Cantha from Sorrow's Furnace, escaping from their Stone Summit dwarf masters. Their fate is not known, given Emperor Usoku's purge, and their tunnels are presumably no longer accessible due to the minions of Primordus.\nThere used to be an asura gate beneath Cantha, indicating that the asura under-empire stretched at least that far south. This gate was part of the first asura gate network, which is now unusable after Primordus's rise destroyed the Central Transfer Chamber.\nSeveral low-resolution textures depicting a world map of Tyria, such as the map in the Durmand Priory or the Order Threat Assessment Board, depict Shing Jea as being a peninsula rather than an island, as it was in Guild Wars Factions. These maps also do not depict the Jade Sea as an inland sea but as part of the landmass, but this may just be because Cantha's isolationism makes it impossible to know its current internal geography.\nOfficial maps released by developers have shown Shing Jea as an island and the Jade Sea as a solid landmass.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn Guild Wars Factions, the Empire of the Dragon was inspired by a blend of different Asian cultures.\nKurzick and Luxon names were respectively more German- and Greek-flavored.\nThe overall art direction for the Kurzicks faction was inspired by Gothic architecture, while the overall art direction for the Luxons faction was inspired by Southeast Asian cultures.\nLuxon may be a reference to Luzon island.\nAt one point, Divinity's Reach contained a Canthan and Arts district similar to the Ossan Quarter and Rurikton; however, developers have pointed out that the canonicity of the Canthan district's existence is dubious due to changes made prior to the game's launch even though the district has been referred to in the canonical Ghosts of Ascalon novel and in the personal story instance Suspicious Activity. The district was removed late in development and was replaced with the Great Collapse. Map artist Josh Foreman has said that a lot of the development team would like to return to Cantha and encourages interested players to ask for a future Canthan region.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLegendary Alliance Stance\nLegendary Assassin Stance\nLunar New Year\nShing Jea Orchid\nXunlai Guild\nAssociated items\n  Celestial Ministry Cape\n  Celestial Sigil\n  Imperial Chef Yileng's Golden Spoon\n  Jade Wind Orb\n  Kurzick Bauble\n  Lost Seal of Usoku\n  Luxon Pendant\n  Mark of the Imperial Guard\n  Moon Shell\n  Plague Idol\n  Petrified Skull Juju\n  Symbol of the Deceiver\n  Usoku's Needle\n  Wayward Wand Scepter\n\n\n== References ==",

      "strName": "Super Adventure Box",
      "strWikiText": "Super Adventure Box, or SAB, is a special activity originally introduced during the eponymous release as part of April Fools' Day 2013. Originally accessed by talking to Moto in Creator's Commons, it is a \"game within a game\" with an 8-bit platformer theme, sharing some elements with jumping puzzles, and uses the same enter mechanism as dungeons and thus can be completed alone or with a group of up to five players. The activity is character-based: any items and upgrades obtained on one character do not carry over to other characters. While inside, players are able to earn Bauble Bubbles that can be exchanged with Moto for various items.\nAll players start off on equal ground: Players will be under a hidden transform effect, effectively making all skills inaccessible except for the ones given inside the box. Current equipment and traits will have no effect on the character. The player cannot change, equip, or remove equipment while in the box. Prior to the March 29, 2022 update, all effects on the character were removed upon entering the box, including those from boosts. The only elements that persisted outside the box were items obtained in the box, such as baubles. Since this update, food, utility and other positive boosts are suspended and resumed upon return to Tyria.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nPortal to Super Adventure Box\nCreator's Commons (Rata Sum) located directly west of Magustan Court Waypoint\nHall of Monuments (Eye of the North) located next to Eye of the North Waypoint\n  Invitation to the Super Adventure Festival\n  Invitation to the Party\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n=== Hub ===\n\nThe Hub contains portal houses to four worlds and a gate back to Rata Sum. Players can start a world by entering a door and then selecting a difficulty level and zone. Players can only visit zones they have already completed. This acts as a level select mechanic for the platformer.\n\n\n=== Worlds and zones ===\nSuper Adventure Box is divided in four worlds, each in turn divided in a total of three zones plus a bonus zone. Each zone is unlocked after completing the previous one, and all of them can be accessed and played individually without needing to complete the entire world in a go. The first and second zones have a Cage as the final boss, while the third zones have a unique and harder boss. The bonus zone requires completion of the third zone to be accessed each time.\nWorlds three and four are not currently available, but might be available in the future.\n\n\n== Difficulty ==\n\n\n== Interface ==\n\nEnergy bar\nThe yellow bar represents the character's endurance, or ability to dodge in order to evade attacks in the SAB (Super Adventure Box) similarly to the rest of the game. Any enemy attack can be evaded if timed correctly, excluding traps like the flytraps (note, however, that ending the dodge roll inside an enemy causes damage and knockback)[verification requested].\n\nHearts\n\nThe number of hearts displayed represents the player's health bar. All players start off with three hearts. Normal hits received use up one heart, while weaker hits (from poisonous water, for example) can use up half a heart. The number of hearts, the player's total health, can be increased by gaining Heart Vessels. A Heart Vessel is obtained by defeating the final boss of each world in any mode. Players can only obtain one Heart Vessel per world. If a player loses all their hearts, they lose a life and are moved back to the last known checkpoint with maximum hearts. Players can restore lost hearts by eating food which can drop from enemies or from breaking items in shops. Players can also heal themselves as usual, by using skill #6, which requires recharging by purchasing Health Refills from shopkeepers. The Health Potion healing skill can hold up to 9 charges. It is currently not possible to heal other players.\nThere is no falling damage, no matter how far down the player falls or jumps, provided they land on a solid surface. Falling into an abyss, however, sends the player back to the last known checkpoint with one heart less.\n\nLives\n\nPlayers start off with two lives at the beginning of each zone, and more lives can be purchased from certain shopkeepers in each zone. When a player loses all their lives, they are moved to the Game Over room, surrounded by ticking bombs, rising lava, and spiked walls. However, Moto will be there to offer assistance, allowing players to either use a Continue Coin or purchase one for 50 Baubles, which will give them 5 lives (99 lives with an Infinite Continue Coin) and move them back to the last activated checkpoint. If the player has no continue coins and not enough baubles to buy one, or declines to buy one, they will be returned to the Hub and all progress on the zone they were on will be reset if they were either in Tribulation Mode or not in a party. Continue Coins are also available from Moto outside of the Super Adventure Box in Creator's Commons, at a cost of ten Baubles for one coin.\n\nBauble count\nBaubles are used as currency, allowing various skills and items to be purchased from the shopkeepers in the various levels of the SAB, as well as from Moto. Initially, players can carry only 250 baubles, but this limit can be increased to 500 with the purchase of a Bauble Purse and further to 750 with a Bauble Tote Bag. Once the limit is reached, or before that, one can exit the SAB and convert their baubles to Bauble Bubbles from Moto at the rate of 250 baubles for 1 bubble. The number shown is that of the baubles that are in the player character's inventory, excluding any which may be in their vault or on other characters.\nThe colors used by the baubles which can be picked up in the SAB are aligned with the rarity paradigm used for equipment, with different colored baubles granting a different number of blue baubles (the base currency):\n\n\tBaubles\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe baubles dropped by monsters will disappear if not picked up within a short time (around 10 sec).\n\n\n== Upgrades and skills ==\n\nMost upgrades and their corresponding skills, if any, are purchased from shopkeepers across each zone, or obtained as rewards. Skills and other purchased enhancements are character-bound (will only be available to that character which bought the skill). Being swallowed by certain enemies removes all skills except for a special skill which should be used to regain freedom.\n\nPower-ups\nPower-ups can be found inside of barrels in Super Adventure Box and grant the player specific buffs for a short time:\n\nDamage Boost causes players to deal double damage.\nInvincibility gives the player a buff that makes them invulnerable to incoming damage as well as poison water for the duration.\nInvisibility grants the player stealth.\nSpeed Boost gives the player a buff similar to Swiftness, increasing their movement speed.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n== Rewards ==\nAlong with Baubles, various skins have a chance to be earned in game from Glorious Chests, as well as items to create certain skins outside of the Super Adventure Box. There are currently five skin sets, each containing all 16 non-aquatic weapons and a backpack, and each set shares the same models and animations, but is colored in a different hue, their color following the Bauble value color scale. Skins acquired as random drops from Glorious Chests can be traded, while skins from all other sources are account bound. Additionally, players can obtain Fancy Furniture Coins from hidden shops which can be used to create various guild decorations.\n\nGlorious Chests\nGlorious Chests are awarded for completing a zone in Normal Mode and Tribulation Mode. Each chest can only be acquired once a day per account for the zone and mode, making a total of 12 of these chests; one per zone in Normal Mode and one per zone in Tribulation Mode. The exception to this is the two bonus zones Cart and Robbers. They reward a single Bauble Bubble instead of a Glorious Chest of which can only be acquired once per day per account, regardless of difficulty. Each Glorious Chest contains:\n\n2   Bauble Bubbles (4 in World 2 in Tribulation Mode)\n1   Continue Coin\nThere is a small chance for it to contain the following:\n\n  Super weapon skins1\n  Super Weapon Box (Blue SAB weapons)\n  Kaiser Snake Weapon Box (Orange SAB weapons)\n1 The drop rate was 2% in 2013, the current rate has not been confirmed.\nEach completion of a zone will reward a Bonus Reward Chest that is awarded at the end of the timer for transition:\n\n5-50   Bauble (random amount, infantile mode does not give Bonus Reward Chest)\nAdditionally, upon completing the different zones in Tribulation mode, players will receive a trophy specific to that world and zone which can be used to craft various skins:\n\nCompleting World 1 zones will award items for crafting King Toad's weapon skins:\n  King Toad Z-1\n  King Toad Z-2\n  King Toad Z-3\nCompleting World 2 zones will award items for crafting Storm Wizard's weapon skins\n  Storm Wizard Z-1\n  Storm Wizard Z-2\n  Storm Wizard Z-3\n\n\n== Achievements and Collections ==\nAchievements\nSuper Adventure Box: World 1\nSuper Adventure Box: World 2\nSuper Adventure Box: Tribulation Mode\nSuper Adventure Box: Nostalgia\nDaily Super Adventure Festival achievements during the festival\nGuide to Daily Super Adventure Festival achievements\nWeapon Collections\nThe Super Adventure (Blue skins)\nThe King Toad (Green skins)\nThe Storm Wizard (Yellow skins)\nThe Kaiser (Orange skins)\nThe Crimson Assassin (Red skins)\nThe Glitched Adventure (\"Glitched\" blue skins)\n\n\n== Account unlocks ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nBonus Reward Chest are given at the end of the timer for zone transition.\nZones are only unlocked per character and are not account bound.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nEach of bauble's color matches up with a Super Adventure Box weapon skin set: Blue Baubles/Super weapon skins, Green Baubles/King Toad weapon skins, Yellow Baubles/Storm Wizard's weapon skins, Red Baubles/Crimson Assassin weapon skins, and Purple Baubles/Hardlight weapons.\nThe bottom of the Super Coin says \"SAB ADMIT ONE\". The coin machine was removed with the release of World 2.\nDialogue within the Super Adventure Box is displayed in New Krytan, but is also translated in the chat panel for the player's convenience.\nThe titles of the books in the shops are written in New Krytan. Some of them read:\nPrincess Miya is not Moto (Red books)\nWhy Moto is Great (Blue books)\nAvoid the Genie! (Green books)\nThe open book on some tables seems to be the Red book, saying:\nAs you can see they are totally different people. This is clearly not Moto in a wig and dress.\n\n\n=== Tributes ===\nThe game pays tribute to the 8-bit genre especially to the Mario and Zelda series of games:\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Super Adventure Box Gem Store Offers\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuper Adventure Box on official website\nSuper Adventure Box advertisement - ArenaNet released a tongue-in-cheek video inviting people to play Super Adventure Box.\nSuper Adventure Box is now open\nThe origin of the Super Adventure Box\nThe origin of the Super Adventure Box video\nLord Vanquish Twitter feed\n\n\n== References ==",

      "strName": "Fractals of the Mists",
      "strWikiText": "Fractals of the Mists are a special type of dungeon that consists of an array of mini-dungeons called fractals, where each fractal has its own story and environment. Characters are adjusted to level 80 within the fractal. Fractals are one of the primary sources of ascended equipment and provide materials for crafting infused equipment and attuned equipment. They are one of the core pillars of Guild Wars 2's endgame.\nFractals have some unique mechanics and design. The party can choose the difficulty scale prior to entering the fractal or from within the observatory. This difficulty scale starts at 1 and can be increased, up to 100. The personal fractal level is an account-wide stat that tracks the current position of the account on the difficulty scale. To increase the personal fractal level, and therefore the highest fractal scale accessible to the account, the player must complete a single fractal on a fractal scale equal or greater to their personal fractal level. This provides progression, allowing players to continuously complete higher and higher levels on the difficulty scale and earn greater rewards as a result.\nWhen entering Fractals of the Mists, the players arrive in Mistlock Observatory, a \"hub\" area within the Mists. Entering Mistlock, you'll meet Dessa, a scientist who has made explorable chunks of reality from the Mists. There are hostile elements that were acquired during Mistlock which you are asked to dispose of. You may begin by entering the portal within the Mistlock to enter a fractal. You will hear Dessa's voice while stabilizing the fractal. Once it is stabilized, she and her krewe will transport you back to the Mistlock.\n\n\n== Introduction letter ==\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nLion's Arch - The entrance is an asura gate directly in the center of Fort Marriner in Lion's Arch. Located just south of the \"Mist Portals\" point of interest, look for this icon  on the map.\nMistlock Sanctuary - Requires Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey. The entrance is on the eastern side.\nOnce any member of your party has entered, you will be prompted to join them from anywhere within Lion's Arch or Mistlock Sanctuary.\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\n\n=== Matchmaking ===\n\n\n=== Difficulty scale ===\n\nFractals of the Mists uses a difficulty scale in contrast to the story and explorable modes of dungeons.\n\nYour personal fractal level increases by one each time you complete a fractal scale equal to or greater than your personal level.\nWhoever enters the hub may choose the initial difficulty level, which can be set up to the highest personal fractal level of any member of the current party.\nThe scale may be changed while in the lobby through the Scale Setting Sequencer.\nIncreased personal levels offer increased rewards, even if the run is at a lower difficulty level. Higher difficulty levels offer greater challenges and higher chances of better rewards, from foes, chests, and bonus chests.\nEach fractal scale corresponds with a specific fractal 'island' and set of unique conditions.\nThere are four fractal difficulty scale ranges that are listed in the Looking For Group tool. For new characters, all of these skill ranges are locked (they cannot be used to find groups). The first scale range called \"Initiate Scales 1-25\", will unlock when a character reaches level 80. Higher group scale ranges will unlock when an account's personal fractal level nears the upper boundary for that group. For example, the ability to search in the 51-75 range unlocks when an account's personal fractal level is 46. More details can be found on the page Looking For Group.\nStandard changes at higher difficulty levels\nStandard foes spawn in greater numbers and have higher levels.\nFoes gain increased health and damage values.\nSome foes will gain new abilities, e.g. in the Uncategorized Fractal, the harpies start to knock players back.\nMajor changes at different tiers\nFractals include more substantial changes starting at level 25, 50, 75, so these are called the difficulty \"tiers\".\n\nNew items begin dropping at higher tiers; other items begin dropping more frequently.\nNew challenges are added at new tiers:\nAgony is added to enemy and boss attacks at level 20, and it continues to increase with each level.\nA Mistlock Instability is added at level 26, with additional instabilities added at levels 51 and 76 (for a total of 3).\nStarting at level 71, whenever a player gets downed a Fractal Avenger will spawn to finish the player.\nInterrupting or killing it will cause it to disappear. If a downed player stealths or teleports away, it will continue its finisher, but it will fail if a player is still stealthed or has moved far enough away by the time its animation finishes.\nFractals with the Fractal Vindicator instability will spawn a Fractal Vindicator instead, which deals heavy damage to its target and persists until slain. Unlike with the avengers, only one vindicator will spawn per player whenever they go downed until their current vindicator has been slain.\nDaily Fractals rewards are available for difficulties 1-25, 26-50, 51-75 and 76-100.\n\n\n=== Mistlock Observatory ===\nThe Mistlock Observatory serves as the hub (or lobby) area for the dungeon. It offers armor repairs and a variety of merchants that sell fractal related gear, potions, and infusions. A portal in the center of the area can be used to access the fractals; this requires confirmation from all players in the party.\n\n\n=== Differences from dungeons ===\nThere are no waypoints. If any party member dies, they must wait to be revived by their party or for the rest of the party to get out-of-combat, at which point any defeated member is given the option to teleport back to the most recently completed checkpoint (or to leave the fractal entirely).\nAny character that re-enters an existing fractal instance (excluding the lobby) will spawn dead.\nAny characters under level 80 will be scaled up, allowing lower-level characters to participate, though stats gained from gear will still be lower, and mobs will generally target lower leveled players specifically.\n\n\n=== Agony ===\n\nAgony is an effect introduced starting at scale 20, reducing healing and dealing a large percentage of your maximum health as damage per second. The amount of damage inflicted gradually increases as the difficulty scale increases, starting at 10% and capping out at 180%. Certain mechanics, mistlock instabilities, and enemy attacks will apply Agony.\nThe damage taken from Agony can be reduced with Agony Resistance, down to a minimum of 1%. The main source of Agony Resistance are from infusions that can be placed in Ascended and Legendary equipment. Temporary Agony Resistance can be obtained from using an Anguished Tear of Alba.\n\n\n=== Mistlock Instability ===\nMistlock Instabilities are special modifiers that have various effects on players and their party's journey through the Fractals of the Mists. These can be anything from simple conditions to insidious extra creature attacks. These effects start at difficulty scale 26. Starting at difficulty scale 51 there are two Mistlock Instabilities active, and at scale 76 there are three Mistlock Instabilities active. Active instabilities can be previewed from the difficulty scale selected or viewed on your effects bar. Mistlock Instabilities will be assigned randomly every day.\n\nMistlock instability iteration\n\nHistorical Mistlock Instabilities\nThese mistlock instabilities were either renamed, reworked, or removed.\n\n\n=== Fractal Masteries ===\nFractal Attunements is a special mastery track introduced with Heart of Thorns. In addition to providing access to additional rewards and daily achievements, these masteries unlock certain NPCs in the Mistlock Observatory. Through these NPCs players can gain access to Infusion Extraction Devices, special crafting materials and other rewards. These are extremely helpful in completing the higher difficulty scales. In addition, players pursuing the Legendary Backpiece collection will need high fractal mastery to obtain the rare collection items required.\n\n\n=== Fractal Potions ===\n\nThere are three types of fractal potions available: offensive (increased outgoing damage), defensive (decreased incoming damage) and mobility (increased movement speed) potions. These consumables stack up to five times (Large potions apply all five stacks in one use), and can be used in addition to nourishment and utility consumables. Depending on the Fractal Attunement mastery rank achieved, each potion may provide additional bonuses to vitality, toughness and concentration, respectively.\n\n\n=== Account Augmentations ===\nAccount Augmentations are upgrades that can be purchased from Deroir and grant additional rewards for completing a fractal and account wide agony resistance. Each upgrade has four tiers and get progressively more expensive.\n\n\n== List of fractals ==\n\n1 Foe types are listed for those interested in using appropriate nourishment and/or sigils.\n2 Sigil of the Night is effective in the fractals that are in permanent nighttime, including the Solid Ocean fractal with the Jade Maw.\n3 There is only a single foe or a group of this type in the fractal.\n4 Powerful Potion of Outlaw Slaying is effective as bandits are outlaws.\n\n\n=== Fractal levels ===\nEach difficulty scale corresponds with a specific fractal 'island'. Agony is introduced at level 20, and its damage increases with the scale. The table below shows the island for each scale plus the minimum amount of agony resistance required to reduce damage from agony to its minimum of 1% of your total health per tick.\n(You can reach this table from in-game at any time by typing /wiki fl into the chat box.)\n\n\n== Daily Fractals ==\nThere are two types of daily fractals: Tier N and Recommended. In every tier there is at least one fractal for each of the three Tier N Dailies. In each of the three lower tiers (1-25, 26-50, 51-75) there will be one Recommended fractal.\nAll Daily Fractal reward chests contain a Pristine Fractal Relic and some +1 Agony Infusions.\n(Click here to purge the server cache, this forces the server to update the contents.)\n\n\n=== Tier N Fractals ===\nThe Tier N Fractal daily achievements are on a 15-day rotation as indicated on the following table.\n\nCompleting a daily fractal will reward players with a chest depending on which tier was completed:\n\nTier 1 - Fractal Initiate's Chest\nTier 2 - Fractal Adept's Chest and all lower tiers\nTier 3 - Fractal Expert's Chest and all lower tiers\nTier 4 - Fractal Master's Chest and all lower tiers\n\n\n=== Recommended Fractals ===\nRecommended fractals are on a 15-day rotation; one at each tier excluding Master.\n\nAdept and Expert tier Recommended fractals require the Follows Advice mastery. Unlike the Tier N fractals, Recommended fractals are always a single scale.\nCompleting a Recommended fractal will reward players with a Research Chest depending on the tier. All Research Chests will give a Fractal Research Page and a large Fractal Potion depending on the chest.\n\nFractal Initiate's Research Chest - Large Mist Defensive Potion\nFractal Adept's Research Chest - Large Mist Mobility Potion\nFractal Expert's Research Chest - Large Mist Offensive Potion\nFractal Research Pages, in conjunction with Grandmaster Marks, can be used to exchange for Ascended chests through BLING-9009. They can also be used to combine into Fractal Journals, which are used for certain steps of the Ad Infinitum collection and towards acquiring Mist Attunement 1 and Mist Attunement 3.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n\n\n=== Personal Fractal Level Rewards ===\nYour personal fractal level will increase by 1 each time a fractal difficulty scale is completed at or above your current personal fractal level.\nCompleting a fractal awards you up to 3400 karma. Less karma is received if completing a fractal scale closer to your own personal fractal level, although the amount can be increased with karma modifiers.\n\n\n=== Purchasable Reward bonuses ===\nDeroir offers permanent reward increases for your account. They include bonus experience, bonus karma, bonus fractal relics and bonus encryptions.\n\n\n=== Completion Rewards ===\n+1 Agony Infusions\nCharacter equipment (blue quality or higher)\nRecipe: Superior Rune of Resistance (above level 30)\nRecipe: Superior Sigil of Momentum (above level 30)\n\n\n==== Fractal Relics ====\nCompleting a fractal grants a certain amount of fractal relics depending on the scale:\n\nEach level of Mist Attunement acquired adds 1 Handful of Fractal Relics (Scales 1-50) or 1 Pouch of Fractal Relics (Scales 51-100), respectively worth an additional 3 and 5 relics each.\n\n\n==== Fractal Encryptions ====\nCompleting a fractal grants a certain amount of fractal encryptions depending on the scale:\n\nEach level of Mist Attunement acquired increases the number of encryptions dropped by 1.\nThe Chaos Isles Fractal, Nightmare Fractal and the Deepstone Fractal give 1 extra Fractal Encryption on scales below 40 and 2 extra Fractal Encryption on scales higher than 40.\nThere is also a small chance to get a Fractal Encryption Key instead of one Fractal Encryption.\n\n\n==== Experience ====\nCompleting fractals awards experience central Tyria mastery experience in the form of Writs of Tyrian Mastery:\n\nEach level of Fractal Empowerment acquired increases the number of writs dropped by 1.\n\n\n=== Ascended Crafting Materials ===\nCertain crafting materials can be obtained as random loot from foes in the Fractals of the Mists; unlike the above rewards, these drop from killing ordinary enemies, not for completing fractals. Each has a minimum difficulty scale at which it can appear. As of July 26th 2016, these can also be bought from INFUZ-5959.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n Daily — complete a single fractal for Daily Fractal (not available every day)\n Daily Fractals — complete specific fractals and fractals in level ranges, additional achievements unlock with Follows Advice mastery\n Weekly Fractals – Complete a certain amount of unique fractals at different scales (Open the page for more information)\n Fractals of the Mists — complete each fractal island and specific tasks in each\n Nightmare Fractal — tasks and challenges specific to the Nightmare Fractal\n Shattered Observatory Fractal — tasks and challenges specific to the Shattered Observatory Fractal\n Sunqua Peak Fractal — tasks and challenges specific to the Sunqua Peak Fractal\n Fractured! (historical) — a category from the Fractured release\n\n\n== Tips ==\nSkills that block, absorb or reflect projectiles are very important in the Fractals of the Mists, as almost all fractals have multiple enemies that use ranged attacks and skills and many of them let you deal massive spike damage if you time your reflections properly.\nSkills that provide Stability, Blind or Weakness and skills that remove Conditions and Boons are very useful during many encounters in the Fractals of the Mists. Be prepared to switch skills often before different encounters.\nSkills that remove or corrupt enemy Boons are especially useful in higher-tier fractals with the 'No Pain, No Gain' instability, all the dredge fractals as well as some parts of Aetherblade-themed fractals.\nCrowd control skills such as dazes, stuns and knockbacks help break defiance bars, which give your party a reprieve from boss attacks while boosting your own damage. This technique is critical in some fractals such as Nightmare and Shattered Observatory, where bosses have devastating attacks that can only be stopped by breaking it.\nSome enemies, like Jade Colossi in Solid Ocean, who reflect most projectiles and are best fought with melee or non-projectile based attacks.\n\n\n== Related achievements ==\n Daily: Daily Fractal — Complete 1 fractal in the Fractals of the Mists through the portal in Lion's Arch. (0)\n Community: Channel the Creator — Complete a fractal with an ArenaNet employee. (0)\n\n\n== See also ==\nBundles for fractals and dungeons\n\n\n== Notes ==\nMost fractals are designed for more than one person. For instance, you need at least three to complete the Underground Facility.\nThe Fractal Instability Trainer gives access to a training area where players can test their build against agony, mistlock instabilities, and enemies of various ranks.\nIn-game description:\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nFractals of the Mists was introduced as part of the Lost Shores release (November 16th, 2012), which also added the first ascended items into the game.\n3 new fractals and 2 new boss fractals were introduced as part of Fractured release (November 26th 2013). These are Thaumanova Reactor Fractal, Aetherblade Fractal, Molten Furnace Fractal, Captain Mai Trin Boss Fractal and the Molten Boss Fractal. In addition, personal fractal levels were made account-bound rather than character-bound.\nThe entrance to Fractals of the Mists originally was outside the Consortium Gift Shop in Fort Marriner in Lion's Arch. With the destruction of Lion's Arch (Escape from Lion's Arch release) it was moved to Vigil Keep in Gendarran Fields. During the rebuilding of Lion's Arch (May 19th, 2015 patch) the entrance was relocated to Postern Ward, and after the building work was completed (June 23rd, 2015 patch) it moved back to Fort Marriner.\nNumerous changes took effect with the Heart of Thorns release (October 23rd, 2015). These include an increase of the max scale to 100, introduction of new challenges and instabilities, the legendary fractal backpiece, the elimination of the old 4 fractals islands per run system, and a complete reworking of fractal rewards.\nSince Heart of Thorns' release and during the timeframe of Living World Season 3, the Fractals have seen the addition of three new fractals (Chaos Isles, Nightmare and Shattered Observatory) and numerous quality-of-life changes in order to make them more engaging. Major highlights include the streamlining of Agony infusions, revamp of the Mistlock Observatory lobby and reworks to the Cliffside, Swampland, Snowblind and Thaumanova Reactor fractals.\nWith the release of the first Living World Season 4 Episode: Daybreak (November 28th, 2017) the Twilight Oasis fractal was introduced. The Molten Boss and Mai Trin fractals were also reworked.\nWith the release of Living World Season 4, Episode 3: Long Live the Lich (June 26, 2018) the Deepstone fractal was introduced.\nWith the release of Living World Season 4, Episode 5: All or Nothing (January 8, 2019) the Siren's Reef fractal was introduced.\nOn September 15, 2020, the Sunqua Peak fractal was introduced.\n\n\n== External links ==\nFractals of the Mists teaser",

It was named after a legendary dwarf who held off a Hill Giant invasion single-handedly in 534 AE.\nLornar's Pass is one of two main passes through the Shiverpeak Mountains (the other being Borlis Pass, which runs through Snowden Drifts to the north) that is to the west of Hoelbrak. The Durmand Priory's main base is located here. There are reports by some norn of creatures made of metal and steam invading this area. In the southeastern portion of the map, there is a long-abandoned temple of Grenth.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nFrom Lion's Arch: The portal to Lornar's Pass is in the east of Lion's Arch, a few steps east of the Cavern Waypoint.

The portal is east of the Marshwatch Haven Waypoint. This portal leads to the Stonescatter Waypoint in Stonescatter Wash in Lornar's Pass. The area near the portal has aggressive level 34 wasps in it. There's an additional portal, connecting the grotto in Mentecki Pass with Demon's Maw in Lornar's Pass.\nFrom Snowden Drifts: The portal is on the south side of the map, in the area marked Lornar's Gate. The nearest waypoint is Lornar's Waypoint. The portal comes out in Lornar's pass near Thunderhorns Waypoint in The Thunderhorns area.\nFrom Dredgehaunt Cliffs: From Toran Hollow Waypoint head west through the portal, ending up at Winterthaw Snowfield.\n\n\n== Map completed ==\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Events ==\n  Defend Lorela from dredge while she gathers griffon eggs (26)\nSuccess:   Drive off the dredge from Korakatt's Hall (26)\n  Help defend the mining camp from skritt (27)\nFailure:   Take the mining camp back from the skritt (27)\n  Use boulders to block off the skritt tunnels (28)\nSuccess:   Kill Korritkir the Chucker (29)\n  Rescue Slagvi from the grawl before they summon their god (28)\nSuccess:   Defeat the grawl shaman before he can reach Slagvi (28)\nFailure:   Help the norn defeat the grawl's ice elemental god (28)\n  Stop the dredge mining operation (28)\n  Escort the artifacts (30)\n  Defeat Reidarr Rockcrusher to calm him down (30)\n  Protect Scholar Penta while she examines the scriptures (30)\n [Group Event] Defeat the champion (30)\n [Group Event] Defeat the champion (31)\n  Search rubble for Deldrimor artifacts to give to Scholar Alil Rodez (31)\nSuccess:   Rescue Scholar Alil Rodez (31)\n [Group Event] Force the ancient creature back into its prison (31)\nSuccess:  [Group Event] Defend Arcanist Dremus from hostile creatures (31)\n [Group Event] Defeat the champion (32)\n  Defend Lyot's ranch from the giant ice wurm (33)\n  Defeat the brimstone imp and summoned imps (34)\n  Drive off the pirates and rescue their prisoner (34)\n [Group Event] Defeat the pirate captain (34)\n  Defend the excavators from dredge (35)\nFailure:   Escort the Durmand Priory expedition to the Molitage Digs (35)\nSuccess:   Clear the dredge out of the dig site (35)\n  Defend Cascade Bridge from pirate bombers (35)\nFailure:   Protect the workers repairing Cascade Bridge (35)\n  Protect Pinion Pass from destroyers (36)\nSuccess:   Slay the giant destroyer crabs (36)\nFailure:   Retake Pinion Pass from the destroyers (36)\nSuccess of either of the 2 above:   Defend Scholar Pekk as he prepares to collapse the destroyer cavern (36)\n  Win three rounds of Modus Sceleris's tournament (37, 61)\n  Stop members of Modus Sceleris from ambushing adventurers (34, 65)\n  Defeat Veland of Modus Sceleris (32, 61)\n  Defeat Orma of Modus Sceleris (32, 63)\n [Group Event] Bonus round: defeat Modus Sceleris (37, 61)\n  Help Blasi steal peglegs from Greybeard's Landing (37)\n  Collect dwarven artifacts from False Lake for Innkeeper Klement (37)\nSuccess:   Defend Klement and Fabri from pirate thieves (37)\nSuccess:   Escort the asuran researchers to Vanjir's Stead (38)\nSuccess:  [Group Event] Defeat Lord Ignius the Eternal (38)\nFailure:   Defeat the transformed pirates (37)\n  Join Armas in hunting the jotun chieftain (38)\n  Give Orson components for his ettin-proof suit (39)\n  Free Venpa and help her reach safety (39)\n  Help Venpa finish the Ettin Proof Suit Mark II (39)\n  Destroy Venpa's malfunctioning Ettin Crusher (39)\n [Group Event] Defeat the champion (40)\nMeta Events\nSteam Insurgence\n [Group Event] Stop the steam creature command squad (30)\nFailure:  [Group Event] Rescue Durmand Priory researchers from the steam creatures (30)\n  Defend Afgar's Steading from the steam creatures (31)\nFailure:   Remove steam creatures from Afgar's Steading (31)\n  Stop fabricators from building the steam outpost (32)\nFailure:   Destroy the outpost created by the steam creatures (30)\n  Destroy the steam creatures' portals (32)\nAn Unlikely Pirate\n  Defeat Crewmaster Chanterlay (36)\n  Defeat Crewmaster Dreggs (36)\n  Defeat Crewmaster Drothan (36)\n  Defeat Crewmaster Plagueshot (36)\n [Group Event] Defeat Captain Jetsam (36)\n  Protect Suwash from the pirate onslaught (36)\n\n\n== Map bonus rewards ==\n\n\n== Karma equipment ==\n\n\n== Pets ==\nJuvenile Alpine Wolf\nThe Godspurs (Small cave South-East of Pinnacle Enclave Waypoint)\nJuvenile Arctodus\nRavenbeak Shrine\nLeopardshadow Shrine\nKorakatt's Hall (Cave just southwest)\nJuvenile Cave Spider\nIronhammer's Crypt\nJuvenile Ice Drake\nFalse Lake (near Dwarves' Gloaming)\nJuvenile Raven\nRefuge Peak (On the cliffs Northeast of the entrance to Priory Bridge near the spiders)\nJuvenile Snow Leopard\nNentor Valley (east, due south of the Icedevil's Waypoint, and north of the road)\nThe Godspurs (Immediately east of Pinnacle Enclave Waypoint, just around the southern tip of the ridge beside the Priory camp)\nJuvenile White Moa\nWinterthaw Snowfield (North of Winterthaw Waypoint)\nLyot's Herd\n\n\n== Crafting resources ==\nResource nodes\n Iron Ore\n Silver Ore\n Gold Ore\n Snow Cherry Saplings\n Fir Saplings\n Grapes (node farm) - west of Greybeard's Landing\n Herb Sprouts\n Onions\n Root Vegetables\n Taproots\n Varied Mushrooms\n Young Herbs\nBulk ingredients\n  Kidney Beans in Bulk from Hune\n\n\n== Notes ==\nFalse River Waypoint was added in an update in January 2014.

      "strWikiText": "Hoelbrak, referred to as the Great Lodge of Hoelbrak, is the largest of the norn settlements that were built after the servants of Jormag drove the norn from their homeland in the Far Shiverpeaks. Hoelbrak was originally the hunting lodge built by Asgeir when he led his people south, placing the fang he took from Jormag in its very center. These days, young norn test their strength against the tooth, and it is said that the one to break it will signal the time for the norn to reclaim their lands. A vast sprawling encampment has grown around the hunting lodge, and Hoelbrak now serves as a central meeting place for the norn.\nThis outpost is dominated by five gigantic structures: the Great Lodge, holding the fang of Jormag, and four lodges dedicated to the Spirits of the Wild: Wolf, Bear, Raven, and Snow Leopard. Here the norn seek wisdom and commune with the spirits.\nIt is located in the Shiverpeak Mountains, rising above the Wayfarer Foothills.\nThe settlement is currently under the care of Knut Whitebear and the settlement that has been erected around the lodge now forms the hub of activity for the norn and those wishing to meet them. The settlement is the safest place around, and so it is from here that hunts are organised, friends meet, and ale moots are held.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Pets ==\nJuvenile Alpine Wolf\nWolf Lodge (Inside the Wolf Lodge, go all the way to the back of room, take the stairs on the right, go right, in a small den outside)\nJuvenile Polar Bear\nLake Mourn (Around the vista on the southern shore of the lake)\nJuvenile Raven\nRaven Lodge (Outside the entrance to the lodge)\nJuvenile Snow Leopard\nPeeta's Gate (Northeast of the asura gate, southwest of the Snow Leopard Lodge)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nConcept arts\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nTalking with Thyrie Bylund reveals that \"Hoelbrak\" is the word for \"lowland\" in the norn's language.\nThe translation from Old Norse of 'Hoelbrak' is, roughly, 'cavern of noise'.\nHoelbrak received a significant redesign prior to game's release.

Keg Brawl is played in Hoelbrak, but currently entered elsewhere.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nYou can enter into a match either by talking to\n\n Kouris, the Citizen NPC for daily activities, located in the Grand Piazza of Lion's Arch, next to the bridge leading to the asura gates.\n Edinna Linhoft the activity NPC onboard the Havoc's Heir (accessible with a Captain's Airship Pass):\n Brewer in Hoelbrak, next to the Courage Brewery point of interest, north-west of the Hero's Compass Waypoint.\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\nTwo teams of five are matched for a game. Each team gets skills which allow them to brawl the other team, such as punching, kicking and knocking each other over. A keg is launched into the middle of the playing area and the objective for the team is to get the keg to their Ale Collector. The aim is to get as many kegs back as possible. The team which scores 11 first or has more points when time ends wins.\nWhen the keg is picked up you get new skills which allow you to pour ale on the ground which makes it slippery or pass the keg. The passing of the keg is ground targeted so there is some skill involved as these passes can be intercepted. Players not carrying a keg are granted swiftness. People carrying the keg are subject to the Barrel Carrier effect.\n\n\n== Skills ==\n\n\n=== Keg skills ===\n\n\n== Rewards ==\nWinner Team\n  Splendid Chest\nLoser Team\n  Chest\n\n\n== Achievements ==\n\n\n== Tips ==\nYou can pass the keg to your Ale Collector or another player with Throw or Lob.\nAlthough Lob is inaccurate, with enough practice you would be able to do relatively accurate long distance shots.\nYou can use Throw while knocked down. Use this if you are about to be disarmed while down.\nTossing a keg out of bounds removes it from the game. This may be useful if you can steal the keg while surrounded deep in the opponent's territory. However, kegs can persist on the ice field outside the fenced arena, and players can jump over the fence to retrieve them.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAle Collector\nLocal\nBrewer\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nAle Collector\n\n\n== Objects ==\nKeg\n\n\n== Ambient dialogue ==\nAle Collector: Ninety-nine barrels of ale on the wall, ninety-nine barrels of ale...\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nYou receive rewards for being on the winning team even if you have a score of 0, but not so on a losing team.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "strWikiText": "The Eye of the North is an ancient, huge tower in the Far Shiverpeaks, with architecture matching that of no known species, and now in ruins. It is topped with a hollow spire, the uppermost part of which has always appeared to be either incomplete or broken off. The Eye contains two rooms—the main interior of the tower, which is large and empty save for ghosts of the Ebon Vanguard and an asura gate, and the Hall of Monuments, which was once full of statues commemorating the deeds of the long-dead hero who defeated the Great Destroyer as well as an ancient Scrying Pool.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nUse the  Eye of the North Waypoint — \nPlayers who have at least one character level 80 will have the waypoint unlocked automatically. However, most services and NPCs still require the Path of Fire expansion and The Icebrood Saga.\nUse the   Icebrood Saga Portal Tome.\nMail informing characters that the waypoint has been unlocked:\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe Eye of the North's origins are a mystery. All that is known of its origin is that it is not of dwarven, asuran, or human construction. It is said to resemble structures at godly sites, such as Arah. The norn of the Far Shiverpeaks were the first of modern species to discover the Eye of the North, and decided to avoid it due to sensing strange magic from it.\n\n\n=== Guild Wars: Eye of the North ===\n\nThe Eye of the North was first brought to the Central Tyrian nations' attention shortly after the Searing when the Ebon Vanguard made a forward base of operations far north to try and covertly disrupt the charr offensive, and eventually saw Captain Langmar being succeeded by Gwen Thackeray as the commander of the unit. During the conflict in the north in 1078 AE, the Eye's Scrying Pool was used by the Hero of Tyria in between missions to decipher the nature of the threat posed by the invading Destroyers and reveal clues about the location of the Great Destroyer which was felled soon after.\n\n\n=== Recent years ===\nThe Ebon Vanguard was recalled to Ascalon City a few years later in 1080 AE, and the tower was left with a skeleton crew to keep the charr believing the Ebon Vanguard were still in the north. When the Elder Dragon Jormag awoke and created the four year long blizzard in 1165 AE, the norn were driven from the region and left the abandoned Eye deep in Icebrood territory.\nThe ghosts of heroes who had once occupied the Eye of the North still lingered within its halls, knowing it as the place where they belonged, to guard the treasures of the Eye and to provide them to the heroes of future generations.\n\n\n=== The Icebrood Saga ===\n\nAfter Aurene's ascension into becoming an Elder Dragon, she took it upon herself to eradicate the Branded created by her predecessor Kralkatorrik. Following this, she was drawn by a confluence of energies and discovered the Eye of the North. Interested in the magic and the Scrying Pool, which she described as having waters that connect threads through the Mists and time, Aurene turned the Hall of Monuments into her new lair and began to study what drew her there.\nAfter the Pact Commander was injured by Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer in 1333 AE, members of Dragon's Watch were guided by Aurene to the Eye of the North so that the Commander could recover in peace, away from Jormag's minions and the charr forces. After recovering, the group wondered what Bangar's next actions would be, and decided it was best to wait for him to make a move first.\nWhen the Pact Commander recovered, Aurene telepathically requested their audience, indicating that she had found something of interest while peering through the Scrying Pool. Meanwhile, the Order of the Crystal Bloom and other individuals, including Mechanist Ninn who repaired the asura gate there, established a base around Aurene's new nest.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Upgrades ==\n\nAlthough all account with a level 80 character can access Eye of the North, not all services are available to all accounts.\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nOriginally, the Path of Fire expansion and The Icebrood Saga were required to enter the hub. Since the July 13, 2021 game update, this no longer applies. However, services are restricted as originally.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nAdded to the game with the March 17, 2020 update.\nThe building in the loading screen of this instance is a composite made using parts of the Milan Cathedral as a base.\n\n\n== References ==",

Every 6 days, extra achievements will reward additional currencies and experience.\nThere are four achievements: using a Thaw Elixir, gathering 5 winterberries, lighting or defending a brazier, and gathering 10 Unbound Magic orbs. Each achievement rewards 3 Chest of the Bitterfrost Frontier Hero.\nSince Bitterfrost Frontier was released as part of Living World Season 3, experience earned here will go towards Heart of Maguuma masteries.\nThe zone's renown hearts have their progress reset daily.\nUnlike other open world zones, Bitterfrost Frontier's day-night cycle is tied to the Beacons of Koda meta event.\nSpecifically, the cycle will start at dawn (5 AM Tyrian Time) at normal rate until “Storm arrives in” some time after 1:00 PM1 . The time will then skip to 8 PM and progresses for a full 5 minutes to 9 PM (Refer to Beacons of Koda for approximate length of time for “Jormag’s Fury”)\n1 \"Storm Arrives in\" used to occur at exactly 1 PM but the times are no longer fixed. It has been observed to occur anywhere between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM\nJormag’s Fury will begin next and the time will now skip to 9 PM; remaining frozen until Defeat Jormag's Champion is over.\nDefeat Jormag's Champion will begin as soon as the bar progression for Jormag's Fury is full.\nAfter all of Jormag's Champions are killed, the time will skip to 5 AM and the cycle will repeat.\nConsequently, the day-night cycle in Bitterfrost will not be synchronized with the rest of Tyria.\nChests in the Bitter Cold give roughly double the loot of other Icebound Chests, and are lootable once per day, per character.\nOrbs of Unbound Magic found in the trees(20) and underwater(33), used to spawn in variable numbers on a rotation basis. All the orbs now spawn daily as permanent nodes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThaw Elixir",

It was the home of Jora and Svanir before Svanir became the Nornbear, and now serves as the location of the Vigil's northernmost base, Jora's Keep, which stands against the Elder Dragon Jormag's forces in northern Tyria.\nAlong the northern edge of Bjora Marches was Darkrime Delves, an ancient cave complex believed by the Stone Summit to house ancient dwarven relics. It was once taken over by a powerful female jotun leader. Ruined shrines of various Spirits of the Wild can be found throughout the region, while the grand Sanctum of Raven stands against the test of time as a monument dedicated to the wisdom of the norn.\nThe lands have been altered by Jormag's freezing influence in the past 150 years since the Elder Ice Dragon made its way south. Since then, Sons of Svanir and Icebrood have spread their influence to the region while gathering an army for the Fraenir of Jormag, horrific Boneskinners lure unsuspecting victims to their doom in

However, unlike Siren's Landing, Bjora Marches does not have any shrines. As of the expansion, there are two waypoints, one in the eastern side, and one in the western side.\nAfter finishing Episode 1, either ghostly visions (Vigil Soldiers, General Almorra Soulkeeper) or \"ghostly\" trees can appear at several places in the map, disappearing when the player gets too close.\nBoneskinners can set up ambushes in specific areas of the zone such as in the Aberrant Forest and at the Southern Mountains. These ambushes may either appear as an ostensibly dynamic event of friendly NPCs being buried under the snow and calling out for help, or letting the player find a wounded NPC lying on the ground. As soon as the player approaches the victim and tries dig them up or offer aid in other ways, the Boneskinner appears and either snatches the victim before the player can save them, or reveals that no friendly NPC ever existed and that the voice calling for help was simply a vocal trap to lure the player into an ambush of Aberrant creatures. The Boneskinner can also stalk the player by stealthing itself; however, other players who are not being stalked can still see the Boneskinner.\nVarious friendly Vigil Recruits can be spotted muttering to themselves and wandering into the wilderness from Jora's Keep. When talked to, they are revealed to be oblivious to the player's presence and simply have a looped conversation with a voice in their head. They eventually sit down at specific spots throughout the zone with new dialogue and slowly freeze to death.\nEssence chests are scattered around the area and with the appropriate mastery can be smashed to loot Eitrite Ingot\nMap of Norn Chest and Glorious Norn Chest can be found here.\nThe three strike missions rotate weekly, with only one available at a time.\n\nThe active strike mission changes every Monday 23:30 just before the daily reset.Click here to purge the server cache, this forces the server to update the contents.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nMaps\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

We've got a problem. It's Braham—he's gone.\n<Character name>: Gone?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: To find Rytlock and Crecia. They haven't checked in for days. I ordered him to stay put, but he wouldn't listen.\n<Character name>: All right. How many Vigil did you send with him?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: None. We're stretched too thin, and he refused to wait for reinforcements.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: Ever since that gate opened, he kept saying we had to go west. Wouldn't shut up about it. Things got heated and he stormed off.\n<Character name>: Yeah. What do you think?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: I think we've lost a lot of norn to the whispers. Norn we trusted.\n<Character name>: I know. But, Jhavi, that's not Braham. I'll meet you at the Vigil Keep.[sic]\n\n\n=== At Bjora Marches ===\nMeeting Jhavi at Jora's Keep\n<Character name>: Any news?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: No. And with everything since Almorra... I don't have any scouts I can send to look for the three of them.\n<Character name>: If Braham was heading west, then I'm heading west. Keep in touch on the comms.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: I will.\nSearching for Braham\n(A spectral wolf appears on the path to the Raven Pass.)\nIf norn:\n<Character name>: It can't be....\nOtherwise:\n<Character name>: What in the world?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: See something?\n<Character name>: Maybe. Not sure yet.\nIf norn:\n<Character name>: There he is again.\nOtherwise:\n<Character name>: There it is again.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: What is it, Commander?\nIf norn:\n<Character name>: It's Wolf, he seems to be leading me West.\nOtherwise:\n<Character name>: Some kind of...presence. A wolf, but...not. It keeps appearing to me the farther west I go.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: Wolf Spirit. Well, follow him! You said he's leading you west?\n<Character name>: Right to the mountain pass. Where Braham was going. What's on the other side?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: A frozen lake. Our people know it well. It's where Svanir gave himself to Jormag.\nIf norn:\n<Character name>: I know the legend. I'm going through the mountains. Catch up when you can.\nOtherwise:\n<Character name>: Don't like that. I'm going through the mountains. Catch up when you can.\n\n\n=== In the instance ===\n<Character name>: Garm! Hang on!\nGarm: (bark)\nClearing the foes\n<Character name>: Garm... Are you hurt?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: Eir's wolf? What's he doing out there?\n<Character name>: I've got a good guess. Garm, where's Braham?\nGarm: (whines)\n<Character name>: Take me to him. Hurry.\nGarm: (bark)\nClearing the next set of foes\n<Character name>: Is that... No. More Svanir. Don't slow down—keep going.\nGarm: (bark)\nFinding Braham\nBraham Eirsson: This time maybe you'll stay down!\n<Character name>: Braham!\nBraham Eirsson: Commander!\nGarm: (bark)\nBraham Eirsson: Little help?\nAfter defeating the Icebrood Menace\nBraham Eirsson: Thanks. Svanir just started pouring out of the forest. Had Garm go call for help.\n<Character name>: How'd you find him all the way out here?\nBraham Eirsson: He found me. Didn't think he was real at first. No idea how he even tracked me down.\n<Character name>: Speaking of tracking down, where are we on Rytlock and Crecia?\nBraham Eirsson: Still missing. But I found something else. The source of the whispers. Jormag's champion.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: Drakkar. Mouthpiece of the Elder Dragon.\nBraham Eirsson: You've, um...probably got some unfinished business there, huh?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: Drakkar turned my great-uncle Svanir into a monster that spawned a Jormag-worshipping death cult.\nBraham Eirsson: I didn't forget. There's a kodan village up ahead. Locals are pretty twitchy; they wouldn't let me in.\nBraham Eirsson: Offered to deal with those Svanir—maybe gain a little goodwill.\n<Character name>: Smart. Maybe they can help us find our wayward charr.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: And if Drakkar is there, then so am I. I'll meet you at that kodan village. Braham, stay put until I get there.\nBraham Eirsson: She won't say it. Not out loud, but I know what she's really thinking.\nApproaching Still Waters Speaking\nBraham Eirsson: Okay, round two.\nBraham Eirsson: We took care of those Svanir for you. Can we get a little gratitude?\nKodan Guard (1): And who is this?\n<Character name>: I am the Pact commander.\nKodan Guard (1): The dragon slayer? Here? No...no, this is a trick. You just want me to open the gate.\nBraham Eirsson: Like I said, pretty twitchy.\n<Character name>: We're looking for our compatriots. Two charr. They were scouting this valley.\nKodan Guard (1): How do you know about—? You're with them, aren't you? Your voice is broken, but I still speak for myself!\nBraham Eirsson:Woah, hey—!\nKodan Guard (2): Mind your thoughts. Cloudseeker will see these two.\nEntering the village\nCrecia Stoneglow: He wouldn't use Jormag against the Pact. It's a deterrent.\nRytlock Brimstone: Like when he stole those Iron Legion cannons? Aimed 'em right back at Black Citadel. As a deterrent.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Yes, but I talked him down—that's why we need to find him. He listens to me.\n<Character name>: Crecia. Rytlock. What happened?\nCrecia Stoneglow: They thought we were with Bangar. Weren't about to start killing kodan, so we came peacefully.\nRytlock Brimstone: Heh. Mostly.\nCloudseeker: Welcome, dragon slayer. I am Cloudseeker. Claw of Still Waters Speaking. Come, let us talk privately.\nRytlock Brimstone: Be real nice to wrap up the day outside this cage, Commander.\nEntering Cloudseeker's room\nCloudseeker: Your charr friends. They can be trusted? Their voices are their own?\n<Character name>: Yes. They've been tracking an army through these mountains.\n(Cloudseeker conjures images of a charr army above the fire.)\nBraham Eirsson: Whoa.\nCloudseeker: We know of this army. I fear their leader hears a voice that is not his own.\nCloudseeker: Jormag tempts those who seek power. Whispers guide them to Drakkar. Then they are turned, as Svanir was long ago.\n<Character name>: Drakkar. Jormag's champion.\nCloudseeker: More than a champion. A mouthpiece. The Elder Dragon cannot whisper beyond its lair without it.\nBraham Eirsson: So: Take out Drakkar, stop the whispers. Maybe Bangar and Ryland come to their senses, too.\nCloudseeker: Drakkar is protected, and by not any ordinary magic.\n(Cloudseeker conjures images of three Spirits of the Wild above the fire.)\n(These lines do not play for norn characters.)\nBraham Eirsson: Impossible... Ox, Eagle, Wolverine?\nBraham Eirsson: The lost Spirits of the Wild! I thought Jormag killed them. We all did.\nCloudseeker: Not killed. Taken. Now Drakkar feeds on them—an infinite well of power.\nKodan Guard(2): My Claw. There is another norn to see you. A leader of the Vigil.\nBraham Eirsson: A friend of ours. Her voice is, uh...also her own.\nCloudseeker: A norn leading the Vigil?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: General Soulkeeper has fallen. I'm here to stop that from happening to anyone else.\n<Character name>: What are you thinking?\nJhavi Jorasdottir: If you can kill an Elder Dragon, then we can kill Drakkar. Every great quarry has a weakness. We just need to find it.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: I've brought some Vigil scouts, but they won't be enough against the dragon's champion.\nCloudseeker: My people are in no condition to fight. They falter. Our clan's Voice is gone. Koda no longer speaks to us.\n<Character name>: We don't have a choice here. If Jormag's luring Bangar into a trap, we need to act now.\nJhavi Jorasdottir: Drakkar corrupted my ancestor. If it turns Bangar and a whole army of charr, that's—\n<Character name>: Not going to happen. Cloudseeker?\nCloudseeker: If you help my people—shake them free of Jormag's influence...I promise we will help you.\nCloudseeker: Go, then. Release your friends. Hunt well, and may your voice remain yours.\nApproaching the cage\nCrecia Stoneglow: This is bigger than our cub. He's grown. You need to focus.\nRytlock Brimstone: What I need is to get out of this damn cage.\nAfter opening the cage\nRytlock Brimstone: Ah. Freedom. Hey, snow-face! Gimme back my stuff.\n(Rytlock walks to a pile next to the cage and takes back his confiscated equipment.)\nCrecia Stoneglow: We'll try to pick up Bangar's trail.\n<Character name>: If it looks like he's diverting back to this lake, let me know. This could get a lot worse.\nRytlock Brimstone: Worse? Lemme tell you about worse. Worse is Bangar getting away. Worse is my son being corrupted by an Elder Dragon.\nRytlock Brimstone: We're going out there. And we're gonna find him.\nCloudseeker: He wants something. Jormag knows it. Mind his voice, or it won't be his much longer.\nCrecia Stoneglow: The whispers... They're more forceful here. I hope you have a plan.\n<Character name>: Working on it. Stay on the comms and keep in touch. Good luck.\nSpeaking with Cloudseeker\nThe whispers tell me I should not trust you. Which is exactly why I dare to.\n Where is everybody?\nCloudseeker: My people have grown...distant to one another. Distant to Koda. Unbalanced.\nCloudseeker: Some left seeking food. Some to rebuild our defenses. Few have returned. Go—find them. Guide them back to Koda.\n What happened to this village's Voice?\nCloudseeker: Her name was Ushers-in-Spring. She was our connection to Koda, as all Voices are.\nCloudseeker: When Drakkar awoke, and the whispers grew louder, she tried to respond. Tried to reason. She listened. And was turned.\nCloudseeker: It is customary for a Claw to step down without a Voice. But I fear if I do, my people will succumb.\nCloudseeker: So I linger—a counterweight to keep what little balance remains. I miss her.\n What exactly are the whispers?\nCloudseeker: They are the ever-present temptation of Jormag. The Elder Dragon speaks to any who might listen.\nCloudseeker: It is one thing to hear the whispers. It's another to heed them. Remember, Jormag does not take. Jormag turns.\nCloudseeker: Jormag's truth becomes your truth. If you desire power, Jormag will give it to you. And you give yourself to Jormag.\n Is Drakkar the source of the whispers?\nCloudseeker: Jormag speaks. But Drakkar is its mouthpiece. The whispers radiate from it, like heat from the sun.\nCloudseeker: Kill Drakkar, and you stop the whispers. It is as simple as that.\n I must go.\n\n\n== My story ==",

The day comes when Bangar will make all our enemies tremble!\nVarinia Stormsounder: False imperators, have some pride. Admit defeat and allow your legions to become greater—to become Dominion.\nVarinia Stormsounder: The false imperators have you fight beside humans and other lesser beings. Dominion fights for Charr Above All!\nVarinia Stormsounder: Charr Above All! Remember the words. Use them to sharpen your steel, your aim, your claws. Charr. Above. All.\nVarinia Stormsounder: As Dominion we will rise together to our rightful ranks! Charr Above All!\nVarinia Stormsounder: In Bangar's Dominion, there are no gladia. There is only the strength of our fangs and claws, and the enemies at our feet.\nVarinia Stormsounder: Fewer and fewer of your comrades remain to stand beside you. Join them in death or join Dominion.\nVarinia Stormsounder: Don't you understand? Dominion will prevail. Join the winning side.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nHistorical\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPrior to the release of Jormag Rising on July 28, 2020, entering the northern half of the map was not possible. A large message with a Dominion emblem and the words \"No Man's Land: You are targeted by a group of Dominion snipers. Flee south or die!\" would appear and both the  Frostbite and  Targeted effects would be immediately applied to the player, resulting first in heavy ticking damage, before being shot and killed by an invisible sniper.\nWhile the map only has two conventional waypoints it is also possible to use the icon of each area like a waypoint provided the area is held by United Legions forces (icon is blue) or is in the process of being captured (icon is still red). Using these airdrops is not possible while airborne.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nDrizzlewood Coast overlaps with the Guild Wars map Verdant Cascades.\nInternally at ArenaNet, this map was known as \"Alpine Cascades\".",

Ignoring Ryland's invulnerable allies, chase Ryland across the map to the bridge.\nThis setting will be familiar if you have played through the Cold War strike mission.\nFight off the two waves of Frost Legion (Jormag corrupted) Charr. At the start of each wave you get one use of the   Artillery Strike special action skill — a large ground-targeted AoE bombardment by Smodur. It might be a good idea to wait with using this until the enemies surround you. Especially the second wave can be overwhelming with its several Veteran and many regular foes.\nAfter the two waves are dealt with, Varinia Stormsounder (the Minister of Morale) appears. The Minister of Morale is a legendary foe. She will summon reinforcements in the form of Propaganda Balloons and Charr tanks which will bomb the area - try to avoid standing in their AoE.\n\nCheckpoints\nWhen replaying the mission there are four available options from the open world portal.\n\nMeet with Ryland. - From the start for the Good Kitty achievement.\nStop Ryland. - After the discussion with Ryland for the Fast Purrsuit achievement.\nMake your stand. - At the bridge for the fight with the Minister of Morale.\nRetreat! - After the fight for the Purrfect Escape achievement.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nComplete the mission.\n\nUpon first entering the negotiation room (after the second large gate) you will find a cat behind the war table to the left of the entrance. Interact with it to earn this achievement. (You must pet it before the nearby Ash Legion Scout shoos it away).\nEligibility may be tracked via  Eligibility: Good Kitty. This effect will appear when you enter the negotiation room, and disappear when the nearby Ash Legion Scout shoos the cat away a few seconds later.\n\nBring swiftness, movement skills or a +25% movement speed signet to catch up with Ryland as fast as possible.\nEligibility may be tracked via  Eligibility: Fast Purrsuit.\n\nAvoid the ordnance raining from the sky, which telegraph as large orange AoEs on the ground. Bring a speed boost to help mitigate the  Chilling Fog, and  Vigor if possible as you can dodge through the areas.\nEligibility may be tracked via  Eligibility: Purrfect Escape.\nIf you fail the challenge, or otherwise wish to reset the instance to try again for this achievement, the instance will begin back at the beginning of the Escape portion, so you will not have to do the previous fights again.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nCharr\nAsh Legion Spy\nCinder Steeltemper\nCrecia Stoneglow\nEfram Greetsglory\nMalice Swordshadow\nRyland Steelcatcher\nRytlock Brimstone\nSmodur the Unflinching\nHumans\nLady Kasmeer Meade\nLogan Thackeray\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nConstructs\nCharr Car\nPropaganda Balloon\nIcebrood\nCorrupted Griffon\nFrost Legion Crusher\nFrost Legion Musketeer\nIcebrood Quaggan\nVarinia Stormsounder\nVeteran Frost Legion Crusher\nVeteran Frost Legion Musketeer\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nEntering the instance:\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: Full house. Ryland should be arriving soon.\n<Character name>: Logan, Kas... Why don't you guys hang back this time.\nCrecia Stoneglow: You've been valuable allies. And I am grateful for all your help. But Ryland—\nLady Kasmeer Mead: We understand. There's too much at stake.\nLogan Thackeray: We're at your service, as long as you need us, Tribune Stoneglow.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Call me Crecia. Commander, let's collect our prisoner.\nReleasing Cinder:\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: Centurion. It's time.\nCinder Steeltemper: Chain me all you want. Ryland will never kneel to you.\nCrecia Stoneglow: It's not about that. It's about saving our people. Including you.\nCinder Steeltemper: You say that now. But get a little power, sink your teeth in...\nRytlock Brimstone: Cub, you've got a lot to lear—\nCinder Steeltemper: Save it. I've learned plenty. Seen and done plenty. Old heads aren't the only ones fit to lead.\nRytlock Brimstone: You've proven yourselves. But choices made in the field stay with you...\nApproaching Smodur and Efram:\n\nEfram Greetsglory: You used a searing crystal. Made my people complicit in your war crime.\nSmodur the Unflinching: I command the beach. There was a weakness to exploit, so I did. And it worked. Very well, actually.\nEfram Greetsglory: Do you even care how much charr blood is on your hands?\nSmodur the Unflinching: Dear Efram. From Flame, I expected backbone.\nEfram Greetsglory: Overstep again and you won't have to worry about Bangar—I'll rip out your throat myself.\nSmodur the Unflinching: As if you've got the claws.\nRytlock Brimstone: I close my eyes, you sound just like Bangar.\nBreaking up the fight:\n\n<Character name>: You have good reason to be angry, Efram. But now's not the time. We need a pact with Ryland.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Do we? We've retaken the territory. No reason to negotiate with Steelcatcher.\n<Character name>: We agreed: Ryland's our best chance to get to Bangar fast and stop him for good.\nIf charr:\n<Character name>: And when me move north, I want more of my people fighting beside me than against me.\nEfram Greetsglory: Crecia will speak for us. All of us.\n<Character name>: You got him here, Crecia. Now get him to listen.\nEntering the next room:\n\nRytlock Brimstone: You, Ryland, leading Blood? That should be our future. Hope Ryland doesn't waste it. Or your lives.\nCinder Steeltemper: Warband above self.\nSmodur the Unflinching: A warband of two.\nCinder Steeltemper: What...? What?\nSmodur the Unflinching: You hadn't heard? Your playmates are defeated and dead. That's war.\nRytlock Brimstone: Real civil.\nRytlock Brimstone: Fahrar can't teach you everything.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Steelcatcher's late. Maybe he doesn't value this one as much as you people think.\nCinder Steeltemper: \"Smodur the Unflinching.\" I fought you, and I'm pretty sure you gave yourself that name.\nRytlock Brimstone: (laugh-cough)\nNegotiating with Ryland:\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: Tribune Steelcatcher.\nRyland Steelcatcher: Tribune Stoneglow. I'm here.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Your warbandmates... I'm very sorry for your loss.\nRyland Steelcatcher: Are you? Gives you the advantage.\nSmodur the Unflinching: You were told to come alone.\nRyland Steelcatcher: I'm talking to Stoneglow. So. What do you want?\nCrecia Stoneglow: Rejoin the legions. Put an end to our people killing each other.\nRyland Steelcatcher: My orders haven't changed.\nCrecia Stoneglow: The situation has changed. Vishen, Nicabar, Ranoah. Are those orders worth your loyalty?\nRyland Steelcatcher: And what orders are you giving?\nCrecia Stoneglow: I'm not giving you orders. I'm trying to bring you home.\nSmodur the Unflinching: (grumbles under his breath)\nRyland Steelcatcher: I'm not some cub who wandered off. And your hostage isn't a toy you're holding until I fall in line.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Think. Bangar's compromised. He's trying to yoke an Elder Dragon! This war will get so much worse.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Steel could turn the tide. Our people flock to you—they're your responsibility. You're their future.\nSmodur the Unflinching: This whole farce is a waste of—\nCrecia Stoneglow: Smodur!\nCutscene:\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: Ryland, every choice has a price. You chose Bangar, and it's cost you the rest of your warband. Isn't that enough?\nRyland Steelcatcher: Crecia, we've always been straight with each other. You say Steel's essential? We're vital to the future?\n(Ryland steps towards Crecia.)\nRyland Steelcatcher: Show of faith: let Cinder walk out of here with me.\n(Crecia lowers her gaze as she ponders Ryland's words.)\nCrecia Stoneglow: I'd need some assurances—\n(In the background, Smodur shakes his head and unsheathes his dagger, stabbing Cinder with it.)\nSmodur the Unflinching: Enough.\n(Cinder gasps in pain and shock. As her strength fades, she lets out a barely audible whisper while the camera zooms in on Ryland's shocked expression.)\nCinder Steeltemper: Ry?\n(Ryland's expression turns into anger as Cinder collapses.)\nSmodur the Unflinching: Don't need traitors.\n(Ryland roars in a mix of rage and anguish and charges at Smodur, only to be stopped by a flame barrier erected by Crecia. He turns to look at Crecia in disbelief. Crecia meets Ryland's gaze with a mix of sadness and guilt.)\nRyland Steelcatcher: I trusted you.\nPursuing Ryland:\n\nRyland Steelcatcher: Dominion!\n(Ryland flees while his Dominion bodyguards block the path and attack the party.)\nCrecia Stoneglow: Commander! We need him!\nEfram Greetsglory: Go! We've got this!\nRytlock Brimstone: Ryland! Wait!\nSmodur the Unflinching: He's not going to get far. Our forces have taken the bridge.\n<Character name>: Then we don't need you, Smodur. You've done more than enough.\nSmodur the Unflinching: I lanced a tumor and cauterized the wound.\nCrecia Stoneglow: You absolute ass. We had a chance to save them, to bring them all home!\nSmodur the Unflinching: We never needed traitors to win against Bangar. It's not a compromise I was willing to make.\n<Character name>: How do we get Ryland back?\nRytlock Brimstone: Smodur's head on a pike...\nSmodur the Unflinching: I am a legion imperator—\nRytlock Brimstone: With no honor. Cre shoulda let Ryland kill you.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Stop! I don't see him. And it's too quiet.\nAmbush at the bridge:\n\n(As the party reaches the bridge, Ryland has vanished, and the bridge is revealed to have been taken over by an army of corrupted charr accompanied by Jormag's minions.)\nRytlock Brimstone: Burn me.\nCrecia Stoneglow: How could you?\nSmodur the Unflinching: Defend yourselves!\nCrecia Stoneglow: What the hell is that.\nVarinia Stormsounder: I warned you before: the tribune was just a taste of Bangar's power.\nVarinia Stormsounder: With Bangar's true leadership and vision, the charr have evolved!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Oh my... Rytlock!\n<Character name>: They look like Sons of Svanir...\nRytlock Brimstone: Ryland's gone!\nCrecia Stoneglow: We can't let them get beyond this valley!\nVarinia Stormsounder: Face the might of the Frost Legion!\nSmodur the Unflinching: I'll take the high ground.\nCrecia Stoneglow: You do that.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Keep them off me, Commander. I'm calling in a bigger gun.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Hold them! Don't let them get around us!\nRytlock Brimstone: They fight smarter than icebrood!\nVarinia Stormsounder: Look at what our imperator has achieved! You should have chosen his side.\nCrecia Stoneglow: You're nothing but Jormag's beasts! Better we kill you all or die trying!\nAt the start of the second wave:\n\nVarinia Stormsounder: You haven't made a dent in our numbers.\nVarinia Stormsounder: Fear the power of Frost!\nAt the start of the fight with Varinia:\n\nVarinia Stormsounder: Look at what our imperator has achieved! You should have chosen his side.\nRandomly during the fight with Varinia:\n\nVarinia Stormsounder: Your minds are too weak to resist the coming storm!\nVarinia Stormsounder: Frost Legion! Cut them down!\nVarinia Stormsounder: Engineers! Obliterate them!\nAfter defeating Varinia:\n\n<Character name>: Fall back!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Retreat and regroup!\nEfram Greetsglory: Behind me! They're coming faster!\nInside the hideout:\n\nEfram Greetsglory: Where's Ryland?\nRytlock Brimstone: Gone. He's gone back to Bangar.\nEfram Greetsglory: You had no right—\nSmodur the Unflinching: It's done. Now—\nMalice Swordshadow: You are not Khan-Ur. No one here will ever bow to you.\n<Character name>: We've lost the bridge. And we met the Frost Legion.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Bangar. He's served our people up as slaves to Jormag.\nCrecia Stoneglow: They're abominations. We've got to end this. Malice, what about your agents in Dominion?\nMalice Swordshadow: How did you—\nCrecia Stoneglow: You're the Ash imperator.\nMalice Swordshadow: I sent double agents to get eyes on Bangar. They will get us the intel we need to stop him. Give them time.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We'll continue to hold the territory. We'll heal. And when a way forward opens, we'll be ready.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nIf you keep up with Ryland too well during the pursuit, you will end up outside of the instance and be kicked.",

And Bangar's managed to throw too many bodies between us and him.\n<Character name>: Maybe Ryland will be reasonable—give us a chance to move some of those bodies out of the line of fire.\nRytlock Brimstone: We'll see. I'm your ride. Meet me at the Eye of the North.\n\n\n=== Eye of the North ===\n<Character name>: Rytlock. How long since you've been on the front?\nRytlock Brimstone: Not for a couple weeks.

Steelcatcher arrived already, and the talk's underway.\n<Character name>: I expected to see more troops. Did you clear out base camp for the parley?\nEfram Greetsglory: Unfortunately, our alliance has been bleeding defectors day and night.\nRytlock Brimstone: Defectors? Still?\nEfram Greetsglory: Worse since you left. Steelcatcher's forces are impressive. And they've come at us with a propaganda assault too.\n<Character name>: That can't be good for morale. Or your forward momentum.\nEfram Greetsglory: It's not. We've lost ground as well as troops to the enemy.\nRytlock Brimstone: Where's the new front line?\nEfram Greetsglory: You're walking through it.\nRytlock Brimstone: Ryland holds both lanes?\nEfram Greetsglory: And everything in between.\nRytlock Brimstone: What's going on?\nIron Legion Soldier: Any last words?\nEfram Greetsglory: Smodur...

But this...it's a waste.\n<Character name>: It's slaughter.\nEfram Greetsglory: Let's work for a swift end to this war, then.\nRyland Steelcatcher: Again, our terms are simple: announce your surrender and proclaim your support of Bangar's campaign.\nSmodur the Unflincting: You've had some luck—but the tides of war are fickle.

The tribune's power is but a taste of Bangar's reach. Next, an Elder Dragon.\nCrecia Stoneglow: This is Bangar's war. He'll lead our people to ruin. But he can't without Ryland. Move aside so we can stop him.\nRyland Steelcatcher: \"Take the territory and hold it.\" I've accomplished my mission and more. I'm offering you mercy at my own discretion.\nCrecia Stoneglow: If you let Bangar wake Jormag, he will destroy us all. Be smar—\nLogan Thackeray: Excuse us, imperators. Is this a bad time?\nRyland Steelcatcher: I offered a parley out of respect. But it's clear your allegiances are askew.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Tribune Stee—\nRyland Steelcatcher: Offer rescinded. See you on the battlefield.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Damn it. Who the hell are you?\nRytlack Brimstone: Uh, Crecia, this is Logan Thackeray. Logan, Tribune Crecia Stoneglow.\nLogan Thackeray: Great to finally meet an old friend of Rytlock's.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Not the time. Commander, take a seat. We need to strategize.\n<Character name>: What are you doing here, Logan?\nLogan Thackeray: The queen sent us with a troop of Seraph to repay Kryta's debt to the Blood Legion.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Your memorable arrival aside, I speak for the imperators when I say we are grateful to have you and Lady Kasmeer with us.\nMalice Swordshadow: Could you give the politicking a rest?\nSmodur the Unflinching: You didn't complain when I brokered our treaty with Ebonhawke.\nMalice Swordshadow: You do like to tell that story. Repeatedly. Your point?\nThings are getting tense.\n <Character name>: Let's stay on topic. This civil war is a smokescreen for Bangar.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We'll never make it to Bangar if we don't regain the territory. We've got to get past Ryland's forces.\n [Don't Intervene.]\nCrecia Stoneglow: We. Are. Losing. Everything. What are we going to do about that?\nMalice Swordshadow: Take a subtler approach. Gather intel, find their weak spots.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Ash. You move in the shadows, collecting secrets you share when you feel like it.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Head-on and face-to-face—that's how you win wars. Dominion's weakest spot is they're wrong and we're right.\n[Decide which side to take.]\n Let's be direct. Dominion can't hold the line indefinitely.\nMalice Swordshadow: The point of intelligence is to help us make informted decisions before we commit our resources.\n We need to be smart and learn about the enemy.\nEfram Greetsglory: We shouldn't abandon our strengths entirely. No matter our numbers.\n Crecia, what do you think?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We don't have the numbers anymore. Head-to-head, we'll lose. We have to rethink our strategy.\nSmodur the Unflinching: The right war machine's worth fifty bodies any day.\nCrecia Stoneglow: No matter how good your machines are, we'll never retake the beach. Not without infantry in the trenches.\nMalice Swordshadow: And who's going to build them? You keep shooting your defectors.\nSmodur the Unflinching: So let's abandon the forest and focus on retaking the beach.\n[Talk to the imperators about the battlefield conditions]\n What exactly is the terrain we're fighting through?\nMalice Swordshadow: Beach on the right. A dense forest on the left... that no war machine has been able to break through.\n Do we have other resources? Anything to give our ground forces an edge?\nEfram Greetsglory: My legion's mostly intact. We can add our magics to Smodur's munitions. Should give an edge.\nRytlock Brimstone: Seraph regulars could easily add to Iron and Flame forces on the beach, right?\n What kind of opponents are we facing with Ryland and his officers?\nCrecia Stoneglow: Good, but young. Steel's following the strategies we were taught—the ones Bangar prefers.\nMalice Swordshadow: A smaller, mobile force would use the forest terrain to our advantage. Ryland won't expect the change in tactics.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Some of the Seraph share mesmer abilities. Malice could factor us in.\nRytlock Brimstone: Maybe it's time to teach the cubs a few new tricks.\n[Establish a strategy]\n We must focus our forces. Concentrated firepower will retake the beach.\nMalice Swordshadow: Dominion is waging a psychological war as well as a physical one. How will we win if we don't do the same?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We're calling ourselves the United Legions—we need to walk the walk. Blood, Ash and mesmers in the forest.\nEfram Greetsglory: And Flame, Iron, and Seraph regulars on the beach. It's a good plan.\nMalice Swordshadow: Seems reasonable.\nSmodur the Unflinching: \"Reasonable?\" Hmph. But I suppose there is value in a flanking force. Pick off enemies fleeing the battle on the beach.\n Guerrilla warfare sounds like the change we need.\nSmodur the Unflinching: And just what kind of damage will hit-and-hide tactics really do? Do you want to get Bangar or not?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We're calling ourselves the United Legions—we need to walk the walk. Blood, Ash and mesmers in the forest.\nEfram Greetsglory: And Flame, Iron, and Seraph regulars on the beach. It's a good plan.\nMalice Swordshadow: Seems reasonable.\nSmodur the Unflinching: \"Reasonable.\" Go. Waste your time in the trees. I'll take my forces and wipe out this Dominion cancer for good.\n Our best strategy is to use every tactic and every resource, everywhere.\nCrecia Stoneglow: The commander is right.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We're calling ourselves the United Legions—we need to walk the walk. Blood, Ash and mesmers in the forest.\nEfram Greetsglory: And Flame, Iron, and Seraph regulars on the beach. It's a good plan.\nMalice Swordshadow: Seems reasonable.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Very well. Do your thing, Swordshadow. On the beach we'll show Dominion's forces—and our own—what it means to be charr.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We've got a mission and a strategy. Commander, I'll meet you and Rytlock at the Blood Legion bivouac.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Your goal is to avoid enemy contact while searching for intel (green scrolls lying on the ground). You start the mission with the Stealth effect, which is lost when you enter the white cone-shaped AoE in front of the foes. You are granted   Assassinate special action skill which can be used five times to remove individual guards, but it is possible to finish the mission without ever using it.\nAs you enter, you are faced with a circular corridor. The pathway to the right is densely overlaid with guards, while the pathway to the left has a patrolling guard that will make staying hidden difficult. In many cases you can proceed stealthily by walking behind stationary guards or jumping up on and passing over elevated terrain.\nThe circular corridor connects to a straight corridor that ends in a large gate. After examining the gate, you will need to locate a key to open it. Several objects will now be labeled as potential hiding places. The one you want is in a room off of the straight corridor with a guard posted directly in front of the door. Carefully approach the door until you get an Interact prompt, then open the door and squeeze in behind the guard. The key is in a bag in this room, and there is also a bit of intel here as well.\nOnce you have the key, return to the door and interact with it to open it. This ends the stealth portion of the mission. Head inside and collect the remaining intel before rejoining your friends outside in mopping up the enemy soldiers. Once they are defeated, return to the locked room for the final showdown with Cinder Steeltemper.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nCollect all intel. Five items can be found before entering the final room; the rest are inside it. This can also be completed in open world after completing the story step. In the open world there is a transport portal covering the the door the intel is in, but it can be found on an exposed brick to the left of the door in the door's archway.\nTo the right of the big rock at the start, on some crates.\nTo the left of the big rock at the start, to the right of the prison cell door (outside the cell).\nIn the sleeping quarters beyond the door which had to be unlocked, on a table to the left.\nIn the sleeping quarters beyond the door which had to be unlocked, underneath the bed with the red awning.\nAmongst the crates on the right near the superior arrow cart and ballista.\nAfter passing through the gate, on the crates to the right.\nAt the war table.\nAt the northern door.\nAgainst the wall in the northeast corner near the catapult.\nTo the left of the steel door from where the legendary foe emerged.\nProgress earned by the party leader during the story instance is awarded to all party members as well.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nDefeat Cinder Steeltemper in under two minutes.\n\nComplete the story step.\n\nDon't lose the stealth effect.

Nothing here.\nCrecia Stoneglow: You were expecting flashing signs? Ryland's craftier than that.\nRytlock Brimstone: Must've gotten it from you.\nCrecia Stoneglow: If I recall, I didn't make a cub all on my own.\nMalice Swordshadow: Look around, Commander. Even a secret base has direction markers. Likely hiding in plain sight.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Report back when you’ve got coordinates.\nEvidence under the log\n\nA note reads, \"Base in basin.\"\n There must be a base around here somewhere...\n<Character name>: Ryland's proving himself quite the strategist.\nRytlock Brimstone: Seeing the leader he's turned out to be...not sure if I should be proud or terrified.\nDirt Scribbling\n\nA note reads, \"South cuts twist deep.\"\n Perhaps along the southern part of the basin, then.\nRytlock Brimstone: Tough, smart... Hate that he's letting Bangar use him like this.\n<Character Name>: You have to let him live with his own decisions, Rytlock.\nRytlock Brimstone: Maybe someday. Not today.\nMysterious Mushroom\n\nA mushroom. It doesn't look edible...\n Not what I'm looking for.\nRytlock Brimstone: Guess sometimes a rock is just a rock.\nSlimy Seaweed\n\nToo wet to be of any use.\n Not what I'm looking for.\nRytlock Brimstone: Seriously?\nRock Carving\n\nA note reads: \"Steel supports rock.\"\nMaybe somewhere along the rocks?\n<Character name>: Think I know how to get to the hidden entrance.\nRytlock Brimstone: Finally. If Ryland's there, I'll tie him down and talk some sense into his thick head.\n<Character name>: You've still got hope then.\nRytlock Brimstone: Got no choice.\nLeaving Breakroot Basin before locating secret hideout\n\nRytlock Brimstone: I'll wait here. Whenever you're ready.\nAt the entrance to the secret hideout\n\n<Character name>: Crecia, we've located the entrance.\nCrecia Stoneglow: I have your position, Commander. Malice and I will meet you there shortly.\nSmodur the Unflinching: As will I. Sounds like a mission for imperators, hmm?\n\n\n=== In the instance ===\n\nSmodur the Unflinching: I disagree with your strategy. Again. A direct attack will take this base in half the time.\nMalice Swordshadow: And give them warning to destroy whatever intel they’ve got in there.\n<Character name>: What's the plan?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We have to assume we'll be outnumbered inside-\nSomdur the Unflinching: If you'd consulted me beforehand, I could have brought a war machine or two.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Regardless. Malice is right. We need to take this base quickly and quietly.\n<Character name>: With a party this big?\nMalice Swordshadow: I can cloak a few of us so we won't be seen. But lumber around like a tank and they will hear you.\nEfram Greetsglory: Why don't Rytlock and I stay out here, cover your tail. Smodur, we could use some extra hands.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Iron, guard.\nIron Legion Sentinel: Yes, sir!\nMalice Swordshadow: I’ve got your back, Commander.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Keep your eyes open. Communications from Bangar, intel about their next strategies—whatever you find, we can use it.\nReaching the war room door\n\nSmodur the Unflinching: I could rig it to blow.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We don't know what or who's on the other side of that door.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Enemy combatants.\n<Character name>: I'd feel better if we had line of sight. Let's find a quieter way to get these doors open.\nMalice Swordshadow: Could be a key around here somewhere.\nInteracting with the various objects\n\nFlag: This doesn't appear to be useful to open the gate.\n Damn.\nBallista: This would be too loud...\n Damn.\nFinding the key\n\nMalice Swordshadow: That should do it. Let's get the hall door open.\nOpening the war room\n\nMalice Swordshadow: Okay, I suggest—\nSmodur the Unflinching: This is ridiculous.\nSmodur the Unflinching: (charging yell)\nDominion Marksman: Intruders!\nMalice Swordshadow: Damn it, Smodur!\nSmodur the Unflinching: That's right, you cowards! Taste the blades of your betters!\nDefeating the guards\n\nCinder Steeltemper: Come and get some!\nSmodur the Unflinching: Watch it!\nCinder Steeltemper: Shoulda taken my tribune's deal!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Throw down your weapon, Steeltemper.\nCinder Steeltemper: Sorry, Stoneglow. Not happening.\nCrecia Stoneglow: You're outnumbered and outmaneuvered, Cinder.\nCinder Steeltemper: You keep telling yourself that, Crecia.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Cinder, please. I've known your whole warband ever since you were cubs. This isn't you!\nCinder Steeltemper: Thought we knew you, too. Guess we were wrong!\nDefeating Cinder\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: Stop!\nSmodur the Unflinching: What do you mean, \"Stop\"?\nCrecia Stoneglow: She's his second. Her life is worth more than her death. To Ryland... To us.\nSpeaking with Crecia\n\n<Character name>: You want to use her as a bargaining chip.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Taking her prisoner will bring Ryland back to the table.\nSmodur the Unflinching: We don't want your cub at the table. We want him off the table.\nCrecia Stoneglow: There's daylight between Ryland and Bangar. We can use it. Get Ryland to see reason and switch sides.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Spare her and we look weak. Eradicate these traitors, win the war. That's the goal.\nEfram Greetsglory: I thought the goal was the survival of the charr.\n<Character name>: Crecia, I get the impulse. But isn't this off-mission? We've got to push north—stop Bangar before he can wake Jormag.\nCrecia Stoneglow: If we can bring Ryland around—and Steel with him—we can use their strength, their intel, against Bangar.\nSmodur the Unflinching: You want to bring him to heel, send him this one's head on a pike.\nMalice Swordshadow: The great diplomat.\n<Character name>: Crecia, the last parley with Ryland didn't end well. What makes you think this can work?\nCrecia Stoneglow: It's what we do for warband.\nRytlock Brimstone: Cre's right. He’ll come. Might even listen.\nCinder Steeltemper: Steel doesn't answer to you anymore. And you don't know Ryland at all.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Shut up, Centurion. I want you alive, but I don't need you conscious.\nSmodur the Unflinching: This is insanity.\nEfram Greetsglory: But if it works, it could end the war without further bloodshed.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Bunch of naïve cubs, all of you.\nMalice Swordshadow: I can get a message to Ryland.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Quietly. We need him to come alone.\nSmodur the Unflinching: (disgusted noise) I'm going back out to win the war.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Good. All the noise you make will give Malice cover.\n<Character name>: Rytlock and I can help with that.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Fine. Meet me at the Iron Pavilion.\nRytlock Brimstone: Rather stick an iron spike in my eye, but fine.\n\n\n== My story ==",

      "strWikiText": "Behind Enemy Lines is the first story step of Jormag Rising, the fourth episode of The Icebrood Saga. \n\n\n== Objectives ==\nRead the Message from M.\nEstablish a foothold behind enemy lines.\nMeet up with your allies in Drizzlewood Coast.\nAsk Crecia for the Ash Legion disguise tonic.\nPlant Dominion charges on the ammo supplies.[sic]: x/3\nSecure the area before continuing: (only if your cover is blown)   \nDetonate the Dominion charges.\nEscape from the beach.\nCenturion Geldius Talonbite   \nMake your way to the cave past the beach.\nCheck in with your allies.\nMelt the ice barriers blocking your path into the caverns.  \nDebrief with your allies.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n  Gilded Strongbox\n  Sip of Liquid Karma\n  Scrap of Icebrood Saga Mastery (2)\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nYou will need to get from one end of the instance to the other.\nThe first half involves crossing a beach guarded by Dominion sentries and destroying three siege cannons on the way while evading detection by sentries. The party owner and NPCs will have the  Dominion Disguise, and while under stealth the party owner will have access to only   Arm Mine and   Ash Legion Stealth skills. Other party members will have the  Ash Legion Stealth effect on them and the   Rush and   Whistle skills available, allowing them to distract guards. Staying outside the marked areas of detection in front of them as they patrol or look around will allow you to pass unchallenged. If you are detected, you'll have three possibly responses and may be able to bluff your way past.  Failing to bluff or taking too long to choose causes all Dominion in the section to turn hostile, and allow access to your normal skills for the duration of combat.\nSiege cannons are destroyed by with explosives picked up from Dominion Charges. Equipping a bundle takes three seconds and leaves the player vulnerable to patrolling Dominion sentries. When close enough to a cannon, using   Arm Mine starts planting a charge, the player must succeed at a match-the-pattern mini-game using the   Blue Symbol,   Red Symbol,   Yellow Symbol in order to plant a bomb. (This is similar to that of the Find and defuse Dominion mines event.) Inputting an incorrect pattern or taking too long causes the player to fail, and the player will have to try again after a short period of time. The process of planting a bomb takes about five seconds and exposes the player to being detected, but a player can use Dominion Charge's second skill to give themselves stealth before they try to plant the mine. Each successive siege cannon is better guarded and more difficult to sabotage.  \nThe first Dominion Charges bundle is guarded by a Dominion Soldier, but he leaves when the player equips the bundle and proceeds to talk to two other NPCs. Just before the second cannon, there is a Dominion Propaganda Speaker under the rock formation. A player can destroy it, causing the Dominion Engineer past it to stop guarding their spot and try to fix the broken speaker.  Previous Dominion Charges are still available after being used on the nearby cannon, so it may be easier to go back to get charges for a subsequent cannon.\nAfter planting charges on all three siege cannons and detonating them, a Frost Legion champion spawns whom the player must defeat. During the fight, two additional Frost Legion enemies spawn upon reducing the boss's health to 75%, 50%, and 25%.\nThe second half of the instance involves destroying Ice Barriers. Some are guarded by Corrupted Ice Formations, Icebrood Elementals and Veteran Icebrood Colossi.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nComplete the mission.\n\nComplete the mission.\n\nYou will need to kill all the Dominion guarding the beach as well as Gelidus Talonbite (excluding the Frost Legion that spawn during the fight him). You will need to make the charr sentries on the beach hostile to you by deliberately being spotted and failing to talk your way out of trouble. As such, attempting to accomplish this achievement disqualifies you from accomplishing The Ghost achievement.\n\nThis can be attained over multiple instances. In order to lower your chances of getting caught, carefully walk into a stationary enemy's white view field while they are facing towards you. Once the view field lights up, you will notice a second area light up on the outer edge of the curved part of the view field. Position your character within the outer part of the view field, and then select one of the options. Some answers may increase your odds of success, but it is random if that is the case.\nYou get the  Silver Tongued effect for a short while upon choosing correctly.\nCredit is also given to party members for successes by the party leader.\n\nQualifying for this achievement can be tracked by the  Qualify for the Ghost effect. Being spotted at all will disqualify you, regardless of whether you convince the spotting NPC of your disguise. The Ghost and Genuine Imposter can not be completed at the same time.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nCharr\nAsh Legion Shadow\nCrecia Stoneglow\nEmber Doomforge\nIron Legion Engineer\nIron Legion Marksman\nIron Legion Sentinel\nMalice Swordshadow\nRytlock Brimstone\nFelines\nCat (if interacted with during Turnabout)\nNorn\nBraham Eirsson\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nCharr\nDominion Axe Fiend\nDominion Blademaster\nDominion Bladestorm\nDominion Duelist\nDominion Engineer\nDominion Fire Shaman\nDominion Marksman\nDominion Scout\nDominion Sentinel\nDominion Soldier\nDominion Stalker\nVeteran Dominion Blademaster\nVeteran Dominion Fire Shaman\nVeteran Dominion Sentinel\nIcebrood\nCenturion Gelidus Talonbite\nFrost Legion Crusher\nFrost Legion Musketeer\nIcebrood Elemental\nVeteran Icebrood Colossus\n\n\n== Objects ==\nCorrupted Ice Formation\nDead Bird (if the cat is present)\nDominion Charges\nGatling Turret\nIce Barrier\nSuspicious Shrub (reveals the cat)\nWreckage\nBundles\nFlamethrower\nIron Legion Flamethrowers\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Did you just get a dumb letter from Malice?\nIf asura: [verification requested]\n<Character name>: A little caution can't hurt.

Though \"free to venture northward\" isn't exactly covert language.\nCrecia Stoneglow: I just spoke with Malice. Whatever's happening, it isn't a spring thaw. We need all of you back here, now.\nIf in the Ash Legion:\nRytlock Brimstone: Commander, you're Ash Legion—they teach you how to write this crap in the fahrar?\nOtherwise:\nRytlock Brimstone: Why can't Malice just say that? Why does everyone in Ash talk like they're reading bad kodan poetry?\nMalice Swordshadow: It's standard operating procedure. The beachhead by the river. Meet us there.\nRytlock Brimstone: Couldn't have mentioned she was standing right next to you, Cre? No way to fit that in there?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We'll see you on the beachhead, Commander.\n\n\n=== In the instance ===\nUpon entry\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Your agents—did they, uh... Did they see him up there? Ryland?\nMalice Swordshadow: No. Your cub's been a bit of a ghost since the, ah...peace negotiation.\nMalice Swordshadow: Commander. As I'm sure you've noticed, the giant glacier blocking our way north has disappeared.\nBraham Eirsson: How'd it melt so fast?\nMalice Swordshadow: It didn't melt. It retreated. Revealing a cave at the far end of the beach. Now we have an opening.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Not yet we don't. The cave isn't wide enough to accommodate Smodur's heavy artillery. We need to make our opening.\nBraham Eirsson: So, how are we supposed to do that—\nCrecia Stoneglow: —without bringing Bangar's whole army down on us? Malice?\nMalice Swordshadow: You'll be going incognito—using on of our disguise tonics. Here's the plan...\nMalice Swordshadow: Our first order of business is to clear away these siege cannons.\n<Character name>: We could hit those ammo crates. Should take care of the cannons.\nMalice Swordshadow: Dominion's got some ordnance you can borrow. Plant the charges, then detonate them on the far end of the beach.\nRytlock Brimstone: They'll probably notice that.\nMalice Swordshadow: You'll be behind their patrols by then. Assuming you don't get caught.\nMalice Swordshadow: My agents will be waiting ahead to help you clear the path to the caves.\nMalice Swordshadow: Once you've opened a path, Smodur can get his toys behind enemy lines.\nMalice Swordshadow: We'll all rendezvous at our camp in the cave. I'll get my agents into position. Good luck.\n<Character name>: Okay, we'll...\n<Character name>: Wait. Malice? Where'd she go?\nBraham Eirsson: No idea. But that was pretty cool. Let's get down there and take out those cannons.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Right. We should try to avoid open conflict until we do. Rytlock.\nRytlock Brimstone: Did I say anything?\nCrecia Stoneglow: I've got the disguise tonics. Let me know when you're ready, Commander.\nTalking with Crecia\n\nCommander. Let me know when you're ready to hit those cannons.\n I'm ready. I'll take that disguise tonic.\n Can you recap the plan?\nCrecia Stoneglow: Once we're in disguise, we head down to the beach and plant charges next to those siege cannons.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We blow the charges, then work with Malice's agents to clear a path for our troops and for Smodur's siege engines.\n Any new developments here aside from the path north?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We've been holding the line, but it's hard to call that a victory. This new Frost Legion changes everything.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Bangar's going to wake the ice dragon. He's betrayed the charr. We need to push north and stop him.\n Hold on.\nAttempting to move ahead without taking the disguise tonic:\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Hey, look. Commander's pulling a Braham.\nBraham Eirsson: I always called it pulling a Rytlock.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Commander, we can't draw that kind of attention. You'll want the disguise tonic.\nUsing the disguise tonic\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: All right, we'll need to move quickly and quietly. Let's go.\nBraham Eirsson: Ooh, this is weird.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Shh. Pipe down. Keep a low profile.

Could really turn this around.\nDominion Axe Fiend: What's to turn around? We're winning.\nDominion Scout: Oh, we are? Is this what winning looks like?\nDominion Axe Fiend: Well, we're not cutting up any more charr, so that's winning for me.\nDominion Soldier: Until Bangar's planted flags in all three imperator's skulls, we haven't won a thing.\nDominion Scout: Your idea of success is... very specific.\nDominion Soldier: And just you wait 'til the Frost Legion shows up. Legion to end all legions. It's gonna be a bloodbath.\nAt the first cannon\n\nBraham Eirsson: There's the first cannon. We'll watch your back, Commander.\nPlanting the charge\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Okay, that's one.\nAt the second cannon\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: More guards on this one. Be careful, Commander.\nPlanting the charge\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: All right, almost there. Keep it up.\nAt the third cannon\n\nBraham Eirsson: That's a lot of guards.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Easy. Just stay calm.\nPlanting the final charge\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: That's all three charges. Nice work, Commander.\nNear the cave\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Now let's get off this beach and make some noise.\nIf sneaky:\n\n<Character name>: All right, we're clear. Rytlock, blow the charges.\nRytlock Brimstone: Finally—MY turn to blow stuff up.\nIf cleared the beach:\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Is this far enough?\nBraham Eirsson: I don't know, it looks like—\nBraham Eirsson: Spirits, that was loud!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Okay. Looks like we're clear.\nIf cleared the beach of all enemies:\n\nCenturion Gelidus Talonbite: You make a lot of noise, Commander. Makes you easy to find.\nOtherwise:\n\nCenturion Gelidus Talonbite: Hold it! Where do you think you're going, soldiers?\nCenturion Gelidus Talonbite: Report, soldier!\n Looking for a mole, sir!\nLooks like we've found it!\n Damn!\n We heard of reports of a saboteur. We're tracking them.\nIs that the reason for these explosions?\n Yeah, sure.\nHold on. Did you just say, \"yeah, sure\"?\n Yeah, sure.\n I said \"yes, sir.\" I respect your rank of...what was it again?\nCenturion! And you better show some respect.\n Damn it!\n Report this!\nCenturion Gelidus Talonbite: You're not Dominion! Ha!\nCenturion Gelidus Talonbite: You'll never make it off this beach!\nCenturion Gelidus Talonbite: Wipe 'em out! And take their heads to Bangar!\nDefeating Gelidus\n\nBraham Eirsson: That was one tough charr.\nCrecia Stoneglow: That was NOT charr. Never call them that.\nRytlock Brimstone: We're gonna stop this, Cre.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Bet your ass we are.\nFurther up the cave\n\nAsh Legion Shadow: Hey, over here!\nCrecia Stoneglow: You're Malice's agent—you were behind the line. What's the situation up there?\nAsh Legion Shadow: It's bad. Bangar's Dominion is being converted into Frost Legion at an industrial scale.\n<Character name>: Where's this happening? How do we stop it?\nAsh Legion Shadow: There's  a...garrison. Of ice. Sitting over some norn ruins. That's where the charr are being turned. Jormag is there.\n<Character name>: Then we shouldn't waste any time. Malice said you've got a camp farther inside?\nAsh Legion Shadow: It's a work in progress. Actually, first we need to clear away the rest of these ice barricades.\nIf Engineer:\n<Character name>: I can use my flamethrower to take out the ice barricades. Looks like maybe you had the same idea.\nAsh Legion Shadow: You brought your own flamethrower? That's... weird. And considerate. Thank you?\nIf Elementalist:\n<Character name>: Shouldn't be a problem. My elemental magic should make short work of them.\nAsh Legion Shadow: Uh, yeah! That could work. Also, I've got a flamethrower.\nIf asura:\n<Character name>: You know what would be perfect for this? When I was in college I invented a portable frost-dispersion apparatus.\nAsh Legion Shadow: Well, I have a flamethrower. So, that's what we've got.\nIf norn or charr:\n<Character name>: So you brought us a giant flamethrower. I like it.\nAsh Legion Shadow: They're pretty great! We don't get to use 'em much. Nice change of pace.\nOtherwise:\n<Character name>: Hence the flamethrower?\nAsh Legion Shadow: Exactly. Very effective against...you know, ice.\nAsh Legion Shadow: Anyway, once those ice barricades are gone, you can head straight into the camp. Malice is expecting you.\nVenturing into the caves\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: We've got icebrood!\nBraham Eirsson: Only gonna get worse the closer we get to Jormag's keep.\nRytlock Brimstone: Fine. Bring 'em on.\nReaching Malice's camp\n\nMalice Swordshadow: Nice work on the beach. With those cannons gone, we've finally got our foothold.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Your agent told us about the garrison to the north. That Bangar's turning his army into Frost Legion.\nEmber Doomforge: Tribune Doomforge. Bangar says when enough are converted, Jormag'll wake. Thought he was crazy. Then the ice moved.\nBraham Eirsson: Why would Bangar convert his whole army into Frost Legion?\nRytlock Brimstone: What if it's not Bangar calling the shots?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We need to shut this down. Now. If Jormag's waiting for Bangar to deliver an army-\n<Character name>: Then we'll destroy the army. How fast can we get Smodur and his siege engines up here?\nMalice Swordshadow: I sent out the invitation before we even started. But we should be proactive.\nBraham Eirsson: Yeah. Commander, I'm gonna check out those norn ruins near the keep. Might be a way in under there.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Good idea. And while we're gathering our forces here, we'll start chipping away at Bangar's line.\nOptional dialogue with Ember\n\nMalice warned me not to make this personal, but I think we both know better now.\n Ember? Is that you?\n(Ember salutes.)\nEmber Doomforge: Ember Doomforge. I was part of the group that went after the Claw of the Khan-Ur. Seems so long ago.\nEmber Doomforge: Commander, I wanted to thank you. Almorra was my granddam. Because of you, I know the truth. What happened to her.\nEmber Doomforge: Bangar killed Almorra. And now we're going to kill Bangar.\n Aren't you Vigil?\nEmber Doomforge: Now and always. And when my imperator told me about this op, I wanted in. Needed in.\nEmber Doomforge: After what Bangar did to Almorra, the Vigil's turning its focus from dragons to Blood Legion imperators.\nEmber Doomforge: Well. Just the one, really.\n Where's the rest of the Vigil?\nEmber Doomforge: Jhavi's mopping things up in Bjora Marches and Laranthir's getting up to speed. He was in the Grove when Almorra...\nEmber Doomforge: Sorry. We all hoped things would get back to normal after Kralk. But maybe this is the new normal.\n As you were.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Cat brings you a Slab of Poultry Meat as a gift if you pet it after shaking the suspicious bush at the start of the instance, which you can collect by interacting with the Dead Bird at the end of the instance.",

They're trapped here in the keep.\nBraham Eirsson: If Jormag corrupted them—\n<Character name>: Jormag would have more magic than they'd know what to do with.\nRytlock Brimstone: Then let's quit gabbin', get up there, and stop it!\nBraham Eirsson: You think Ryland's up there?\nCrecia Stoneglow: Don't know. But Bangar surely is.\nRytlock Brimstone: I'm countin' on it.\nMalice Swordshadow: If you're inside the keep, I recommend covering your ears...now.\nMalice Swordshadow: Door's still holding! Keep those icebrood off of us! Efram!\nEfram Greetsglory: Again! Hit it again!\nRytlock Brimstone: They're gonna bring this whole place down!\nBraham Eirsson: Good!\nCrecia Stoneglow: With us inside!\nBraham Eirsson: Oh. Not good!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Efram, Malice, are you through?\nEfram Greetsglory: Door's open! Frost Legion doesn't look happy about it!\n<Character name>: Secure the ground level, then find a way up to us.\nEfram Greetsglory: You got it, Commander. Rytlock, if Ryland is there...\nRytlock Brimstone: We'll do what we gotta do.\nEfram Greetsglory: Understood.\nRytlock Brimstone: Right.\nBraham Eirsson: Watch the ceiling!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Pretty big entrance by Malice's standards.\nRytlock Brimstone: I'm sure she'll stab a few Frost Legion in the back on the way up.\nBraham Eirsson: Frost Legion!\nRytlock Brimstone: Get out of our way!\nAt the next group of icebrood\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: Trouble up ahead!\nBraham Eirsson: Not for long!\nAt the first ice wall\n\nBraham Eirsson: Damn it!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Calm down—and think.\n<Character name>: Crecia, you can melt it.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Damn right I can. Rytlock: Sohothin.\nRytlock Brimstone: We're doing this again?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We're doing this again.\nAfter Crecia melts the wall\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Heh. Still got it.\nBraham Eirsson: We need to move. Now.\nRytlock Brimstone: The Spirits?\nBraham Eirsson: They're calling to me. They're...they're in pain.\nBraham Eirsson: If Jormag corrupts them like Ox and the other—\n<Character name>: Come on, we're almost there!\nMalice Swordshadow: We've secured the ground level, but the path up is blocked. Clearing it will take some time.\n<Character name>: Then find another way up! We're getting close to the top.\nEfram Greetsglory: On it!\nAt the second wall of ice\n\nBraham Eirsson: Crecia, Rytlock, you're up!\nRytlock Brimstone: Ready.\nAfter failing their attempt to melt the ice\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: What—\nRytlock Brimstone: Any time, Cre!\nCrecia Stoneglow: It's not working!\nBraham Eirsson: What do you mean it's not working?\nCrecia Stoneglow: Jormag's power. It's stronger here. We need a stronger flame.\nBraham Eirsson: Where are we supposed to—\n<Character name>: Efram! Efram, where are you?\nEfram Greetsglory: Looking for another way up! Where are you?\n<Character name>: You're about to find out.\nBlowing a hole in the roof\n\nBraham Eirsson: Nice!\nMalice Swordshadow: I was just thinking the place could use a skylight.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Everyone, into position. There's an Elder Dragon beyond this wall. We'll be ready for whatever it throws at us.\nBraham Eirsson: Yeah...we will.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Yes. We will.\n<Character name>: Efram, Malice—as you can see, we've got a bit of a problem.\nCrecia Stoneglow: One the Flame Legion imperator is uniquely qualified to mitigate.\nEfram Greetsglory: I am at the United Legions' disposal.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Rytlock?\nRytlock Brimstone: Efram: hit Sohothin with everything you've got.\nBreaking through the ice wall\n\nEfram Greetsglory: Bangar! Justice has arrived! Last chance to lay down your arms!\nMalice Swordshadow: Nice try, Greetsglory. All right, prepare to engage!\nRytlock Brimstone: Knock, knock!\nRytlock Brimstone: BANGAR!\nBangar Ruinbringer: If you were hoping to take me by surprise...\nBangar Ruinbringer: Nice try.\nBraham Eirsson: What are you doing to the Spirits of the Wild?\nBangar Ruinbringer: What Jormag did to Drakkar. Use its power to control the uncontrollable.\nBangar Ruinbringer: Elder Dragons want only magic. And the Spirits are nothing but. So I'll convince them to share it wi—\nCrecia Stoneglow: Rytlock!\nRytlock Brimstone: GO!\nBraham Eirsson: He's absorbing power from the Spirits!\n<Character name>: Then let's cut him off!\nBangar Ruinbringer: You can't stop this. Jormag will wake up regardless.\nBangar Ruinbringer: And when it does, I will tower over not just you—not just the charr—but everything. Everything!\nBangar Ruinbringer: (ROAR!)\nTaking Bangar down to 75% health\n\nBangar Ruinbringer: What—? No. The bow. Where's the—\nRytlock Brimstone: Ryland—!\nRyland Steelcatcher: You told me the bow was to rally the charr. You said you would never use it on Jormag.\nBangar Ruinbringer: The bow is leverage. Nothing more.\nRyland Steelcatcher: Now you want to corrupt the norn Spirits, to wield their power against Jormag. Seems you need a lot of leverage.\nBangar Ruinbringer: Stand down.\nRyland Steelcatcher: No, you're right. Sir. These Spirits do have a use.\nBraham Eirsson: NO! C'mon, we need to free them!\nBangar Ruinbringer: What do you think you're doing, Tribune?\nRyland Steelcatcher: Waking up our dragon.\nBangar Ruinbringer: It's not OUR dragon.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Ryland, you have to stop! If Jormag wakes, there's no going back!\nRyland Steelcatcher: That's the POINT!\nFreeing the first Spirit\n\nBraham Eirsson: Okay! The Spirit's free! Let's get the others!\nFreeing the second Spirit\n\nBraham Eirsson: Great Spirit, go! Leave this place!\nFreeing the third Spirit\n\nBraham Eirsson: That's it! Just one more!\nFreeing all four Spirits\n\nBangar Ruinbringer: What've you...? What've you done?\nRyland Steelcatcher: ENOUGH.\nGetting Bangar down to 25% health\n\nBangar Ruinbringer: (chuckles) If you thought I'd just...roll over...you should've known better.\nJust before Bangar can be defeated\n\nBangar Ruinbringer: JORMAG! IT'S TIME!\nBraham Eirsson: Uhh—Commander?\n<Character name>: We're too late.\nBangar Ruinbringer: You thought you had a chance? You thought you could kill Bangar Ruinbringer?\nRytlock Brimstone: NO!\nCrecia Stoneglow: BANGAR!\nBangar Ruinbringer: Jormag. Your champion awaits.\nJormag: Champion... Well. You did gather my army, and so you will be rewarded.\nCutscene\n(Bangar approaches Jormag and laughs in triumph while Ryland watches from the sidelines.)\nJormag: Rise, Voice of Jormag.\n(Bangar stops laughing as he is caught by surprise.)\nBangar Ruinbringer: \"Voice of\"—?\n(Ice magic concentrates around Bangar, freezing him as ice envelops him.)\nBangar Ruinbringer: (screams of rage)\n(The ice shatters, revealing Bangar who has turned into an icebrood with an icy collar around his neck. He gasps for air with his now raspy voice and falls on his knees, drained by the transformation. Ryland approaches Jormag while Bangar casts a weary glance at him.)\nRyland Steelcatcher: Jormag. I am Ryla–\n(Jormag turns their focus on Ryland, interrupting the charr as the camera leaves Bangar out of the frame.)\nJormag: Ryland Steelcatcher. I know you. A born leader who's waited your whole life for a role worthy of your talents.\n(The camera focuses on Ryland who keeps his eyes on Jormag.)\nRyland Steelcatcher: Yes.\n(The camera focuses on Jormag. The dragon's eyes widen as they emphasize their point.)\nJormag: Your sire's ferocity...your dam's dicipline... All that rage, seething under the surface.\n(Ryland has an almost pained, vulnerable expression on his face as he acknowledges what Jormag has said while focusing solely on the dragon.)\nRyland Steelcatcher: Yes.\n(The camera focuses on Jormag, then cuts to Ryland who narrows his eyes in determination.)\nJormag: Yes. I see you, Ryland. And what you've wanted all along.\n(The camera shows Ryland from behind as he clenches his fist and announces his desire out loud as Jormag watches.)\nRyland Steelcatcher: I want to be your champion.\nJormag: Then rise, Champion of Jormag.\n(Jormag breathes over Ryland, freezing him like they did with Bangar. As the ice shatters, however, Ryland emerges as an icebrood not in a weakened state like Bangar but with strength radiating from him. He turns to face the Commander's party defiantly with Jormag looking on in approval, and the flame-enchanted bow is the only thing on Ryland that is not corrupted.)\nAfter the cutscene\nRytlock Brimstone: Ryland!\nCrecia Stoneglow: What have you become?\nJormag: Come, Champion. Now that I'm awake, things are set in motion.\nJormag: To the rest of you, I leave this gift: my Voice.\n(Jormag and Ryland vanish with the fog while the screen nearly freezes over.)\nBangar Ruinbringer: Motherf—AAAGH!\nVoice of Jormag: I told you we'd all talk to each other again soon. I look forward to our...conversations.\nBangar Ruinbringer: AAAGH!\nRytlock Brimstone: He's...\nCrecia Stoneglow: ...gone.\nEfram Greetsglory: What happened?\nCrecia Stoneglow: Jormag's gone. Ryland, too.\nMalice Swordshadow: Ruinbringer.\nBangar Ruinbringer: (pained rasping)\nMalice Swordshadow: That collar's done something to his voice.\nRytlock Brimstone: What a shame.\nEfram Greetsglory: Place is coming apart! We need to get everyone out of here.\nMalice Swordshadow: What're we doing with him?\nCrecia Stoneglow: He's Jormag's now. Can't kill him. But I'm not letting him near the charr.\n<Character name>: We'll take him to the Eye of the North. To Aurene. She'll want to see this.\n\n\n=== Epilogue ===\nAt the Eye of the North\n\nAurene: This is bad. Even worse than you know.\nAurene: When Jormag woke, there was a great, terrible tremor. I could feel ley energy shifting. The world calling out.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Don't like the sound of that.\nBraham Eirsson: Aurene... Why didn't Jormag kill us? They had every chance in there.\nAurene: Unfortunately, we know as much of Jormag's motives now as we did before.\n<Character name>: So nothing.\nAurene: We are at least consistent.\nRytlock Brimstone: What about our guest?\nAurene: It seems we have two. Jormag's presence is entwined with Bangar's.\n<Character name>: Jormag called Bangar their new \"Voice.\" Are you in danger if we keep him here?\nAurene: All I know for certain is, Jormag has a plan. And for the moment, they want us all alive.\nBraham Eirsson: Lucky us.\nAurene: Stay vigilant, my Champion. Jormag roams free. Tyria calls out in pain. This is going to get worse.\nAurene: I'll wait for Jormag. You must go and prepare this world for the fight to come.\nSpeaking with your allies at the Eye of the North\n\nAurene: Champion, I'm so glad to have you back safely.\n What did Jormag do to Bangar?\nAurene: Jormag can bind their voice to living creatures. Speak through them from a great distance.\nAurene: You saw it with Drakkar and the Whisper of Jormag. Now they have chosen Bangar to serve in this role.\nAurene: His voice is no longer just his own. For now, at least, he is simply a vessel for Jormag.\n Will Jormag try to whisper to you through Bangar?\nAurene: Jormag is welcome to try, but I'd like to think that they're smarter than that.\nAurene: They may be sincere in saying that Bangar is meant as a gift. But Jormag never gives without expecting something in return.\nAurene: So rest assured, my Champion: I'll be watching the charr very carefully.\n Can Jormag eavesdrop on us?\nAurene: I don't believe that's their intent, but it is possible that through Bangar, Jormag could hear us.\nAurene: Or rather it would be, if I hadn't magically bound Bangar's cage.\nAurene: Don't worry, Champion. So long as he's in that cage, I will decide what Jormag hears.\n Where do you think Jormag and Ryland went?\nAurene: I wish I knew. I sense Jormag moving through Tyria, taking advantage of the Mists as Kralkatorrik did.\nAurene: Yet they choose neither to consume nor destroy. Pleasant change of pace, but disturbing nonetheless.\nAurene: That's my long way of saying I have no idea. I'm sorry, Champion.\n Farewell, Aurene.\nCrecia Stoneglow: The Dominion is in shambles. But there's still so much work left to do.\n I'm sorry about Ryland.\nCrecia Stoneglow: He made his choice. Now he'll have to live with the consequences.\nCrecia Stoneglow: He and Bangar both forced me to make my own choice. Who am l loyal to? My imperator? My legion? My blood?\nCrecia Stoneglow: In the end, none of that matters. The charr were nearly destroyed. I can't let that happen again.\n Are you all right leaving Bangar here?\nCrecia Stoneglow: In the watchful care of an Elder Dragon? I think it's safe.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Many of us would've preferred a very public execution. But this? This is more...poetic, I think.\nCrecia Stoneglow: But if he causes any trouble? Tell Aurene to let me know. I'll finish him off myself.\n What will happen to the charr now?\nCrecia Stoneglow: We've fought among ourselves countless times. But this...was nearly the last.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We need stronger leadership. We can't let our hatred grow this strong again.\n We'll talk more later.\nBraham Eirsson: I can't believe Jormag got away. And Ryland...\n You doing okay?\nBraham Eirsson: I just don't get it, Commander. Jormag could've killed me back there. They know one of us has to die.\nBraham Eirsson: I kill Jormag, or Jormag kills me. That's what the Wolf Spirit said. But Jormag spared us. Why?\nBraham Eirsson: Sorry, Commander. Can't let this change anything. It's just... I don't get it.\n Yeah, Ryland...\nBraham Eirsson: Always thought he was...I dunno, better than that? Figured he'd turn on Bangar—but the rest of us too?\nBraham Eirsson: No comin' back from where he's gone. Can't imagine what Rytlock and Crecia are going through.\n We'll get through this. Together.\nRytlock Brimstone: Was really hoping we'd stop Jormag before...all this.\n If you need to talk about Ryland...\nRytlock Brimstone: Thanks. But...nothin' left to say. Whole time I thought he was choosing between us and Bangar. I had it all wrong.\nRytlock Brimstone: I guess it was always about him. If I'da been here, maybe I...\nRytlock Brimstone: Aah, prob'ly not. Cre was here; Cinder, his warband. They believed in him. Didn't matter. He did what he was gonna do.\n What are you going to do now?\nRytlock Brimstone: Well, Cre's gonna need some help knockin' heads together. Lot of bad blood to worry about.\nRytlock Brimstone: But y'know, thinkin' about it? She's prob'ly the best thing that could happen to the charr.\nRytlock Brimstone: And if helpin' her means avoiding another civil war, or war with Tyria, or turning into ice monsters, well...\nRytlock Brimstone: I'm sure as hell in.\n Talk later, Rytlock.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe music that plays during the fight against Bangar is a rendition of the Jormag Rising trailer theme\nThe composition of the music that plays during the cinematic is meant to represent a dialogue between Jormag and Ryland\n\n\n== References ==",

Neither one's a bad plan by our standards. But...\nRytlock Brimstone: We were this close... This close to getting Ryland back.\n<Character Name>: I know.\nRytlock Brimstone: So yeah, not killing Smodur? Harder than it looks.\nAt the negotiation table:\n\nBraham Eirsson: Again—look—I'm not saying my idea's perfect—\nSmodur the Unflinching: You want to take the commander and a strike team through the norn ruins under the keep.\nBraham Eirsson: Yeah, then we go straight up to Bangar and take him out before he wakes up Jormag.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Have you even opened the door to the ruins?\nBraham Eirsson: Well, not yet—\nSmodur the Unflinching: We need the commander with us on the front lines. I am going to stop Bangar, and you are going to help me.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Braham, how close are you to opening the door?\nBraham Eirsson: Close. The Spirits are there, and the carvings clearly say their magic is what opens the way.\nMalice Swordshadow: But you haven't been able to talk with them. Or else they would've let you in by now.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Commander, we can't wait for this...magic. My siege engines are ready. Let's kick in the front door.\nHearing Braham's argument:\n\nCommander, I know I'm asking for a lot here, but I'm sure I can find us a way into the keep.\n What is the key to opening the door?\nBraham Eirsson: The Spirits of the Wild. Their magic, channeled through the runes around the door.\nBraham Eirsson: I've been trying to get Wolf, Raven, Leopard, and Bear to answer. But I think they're keeping their distance.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Maybe for good reason.\nBraham Eirsson: Maybe. But we haven't exhausted our options yet.\n You mentioned the corrupted Spirits before...\nBraham Eirsson: Yeah. If the other Spirits won't answer, maybe they will. It worked back at Drakkar Lake.\nRytlock Brimstone: Are they still corrupted?\nBraham Eirsson: I can handle it.\n What do you think of Smodur's plan?\nBraham Eirsson: Don't get me wrong, Commander. I'm all about kicking in the door and blowing up the place.\nBraham Eirsson: But this is Jormag's territory. Bangar's got the advantage.\nEfram Greetsglory: Yes. No telling what surprises he's got waiting for us in here.\nIf Iron Legion charr:\nSmodur the Unflinching: Commander, you're one of us. You know this is exactly the sort of thing we train for.\nOtherwise:\nSmodur the Unflinching: This is what Iron trains for. This is what we do, Commander.\n Give me a moment.\nSpeaking with Smodur:\n\nBraham's plan is a good one, but Jormag gets closer to waking up every second. We need to march now.\n What's between us and the front door?\nSmodur the Unflinching: Frost Legion, Svanir, and icebrood.\nEfram Greetsglory: Don't forget the Claw of Jormag flying around out there.\nSmodur the Unflinching: Stiff resistance. But I know Bangar's strategies like the back of my paw. Imperators study each other.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Then that means Bangar knows your strategies, too.\nMalice Swordshadow: He absolutely knows your strategies.\nSmodur the Unflinching: And it will avail him nothing. I will end him, Commander. And you will help me.\n Why do you need me on the front lines?\nSmodur the Unflinching: Your presence will send a message. To the legions. To Bangar. He'll see his time has come.\nMalice Swordshadow: What he'll see is all his enemies in the same place at the same time. We call that an opportunity.\nSmodur the Unflinching: I call it fighting on the front lines, Swordshadow. Something you don't know anything about.\n What do you think of Braham's plan?\nSmodur the Unflinching: I think if that door was open we'd be having a different conversation.\nSmodur the Unflinching: But Jormag will wake up. And soon. Every second we argue is a second we give Bangar and the dragon.\n Give me a moment.\nSpeaking with Efram Greetsglory:\n\nEfram Greetsglory: I think we should give Braham the time he needs. If we go all in, we put everyone at risk.\nEfram Greetsglory: We don't even know enough about their defenses. We don't even know how many Frost Legion are in there. I don't like it.\nSpeaking with Kasmeer:\n\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Smodur is confident. Maybe too confident. But this is what he does, for better or worse.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: The ruins under the keep might be a safer choice, but we'd be fools to think Bangar doesn't know about them.\nSpeaking with Rytlock:\n\nRytlock Brimstone: I'd never admit it to his stupid face but Smodur's prob'ly got the right idea. We can't just sit around.\nSpeaking with Crecia:\n\nCrecia Stoneglow: All right, Commander. What do you think?\n<Character Name>: I think we... What is—?\nSmodur the Unflinching: Oh—!\n(Ryland appears through a portal and kills Smodur with a gun.)\nBraham Eirsson: What—?\nEfram Greetsglory: NO!\nCrecia Stoneglow: (gasp of surprise)\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Smodur—!\nRytlock Brimstone: Ryland!\nRyland Steelcatcher: We've got every exit covered. Drop your weapons.\n<Character Name>: You drop yours.\nRyland Steelcatcher: This isn't a negotiation!\nCrecia Stoneglow: Commander, get down!\nMalice Swordshadow: Head on a swivel! They're everywhere!\nEfram Greetsglory: Push them back! We can't let them take the camp!\nEmber Doomforge: Svanir, incoming!\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Hurry! Take out those portals, or they're gonna overwhelm us!\nRytlock Brimstone: Dammit, Ryland!\nCrecia Stoneglow: The portals, Brimstone! Focus!\nAfter holding off the attack:\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Well. That's inconvenient.\nIf charr:\n<Character Name>: It's a lot more than that. Our imperator...\nOtherwise:\n<Character Name>: It's a lot more than that.\nEfram Greetsglory: How did Ryland find us? One of your double agents get caught?\nMalice Swordshadow: We've been blowing up their camps. Loudly. We knew this was bound to happen.\nRytlock Brimstone: Yeah, but not this soon. And not with a hole in Smodur's head.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Doesn't change anything. It can't.\nCrecia Stoneglow: Every second we stand here, more Frost Legion enter the field. Who's Iron's second-in-command?\nMalice Swordshadow: Most likely Mia Kindleshot. Tribune. Smodur trusted her.\n<Character Name>: She helped us fight Kralkatorrik at Thunderhead Peaks. Where is she?\nEmber Doomforge: Not here. But we'll find her.\nCrecia Stoneglow: No time. Efram, you worked pretty closely with Smodur and Iron south of the line.\nEfram Greetsglory: I did. Doesn't mean Iron will take orders from me.\nMalice Swordshadow: They saw you fight alongside Smodur. They respect you. I'll help you organize the rank and file.\nBraham Eirsson: What should I do?\nCrecia Stoneglow: If you can get that door open before we march, we'll go with your plan. But that's as long as we wait.\n<Character Name>: Crecia's right: The more we talk, the bigger the Frost Legion gets. And the the closer Jormag is to waking up.\nCrecia Stoneglow: We're not just fighting to stop Bangar. We're fighting for the future of all the charr. Braham?\nBraham Eirsson: I won't let you down. Commander, meet you there.\nTalking to Efram:\n\nThis is a disaster. An imperator's been assassinated in cold blood.\n We can't let that distract us. Smodur wouldn't want that.\nWe never agreed on much, but he and I both know Bangar was just the first of many problems the charr have before them.\n You mean Jormag?\nJormag. The Dominion. The very beliefs that got us here. Smodur knew that poison runs deep amongst the charr.\n And you're going to help root it out. I know it.\n We'll stop Ryland and Bangar. We have to.\nTalking to Malice:\n\nThis is...inconvenient, to say the least.\n That's all you can say?\nSmodur and I, we've had our differences. But we always made things work. For the good of the charr. Now...\n We owe him a lot. Despite everything.\nWe do. And Iron will remember him a certain way. But Ash, Blood, and Flame? We'll all remember him in different ways, I'm sure.\n I'm sure.\nTalking to Braham:\n\nHey, Commander. You doing okay?\n I'm fine. Can't believe Ryland got the drop on all of us.\nI heard how angry he was after Cinder. At you. At Crecia. But Smodur more than anyone.\n We should have taken greater precautions.\nCan't blame yourself. Knowing what I know about Ryland, he would've found his way in here eventually.\n That's a good point. Anyway, let's focus on getting into Jormag's keep.\n I'll feel better once we've opened that door near the ruins.\nTalking to Crecia:\n\nWe can't let this halt our momentum. We seize up, we die.\n We're not going to stop. I'll work with Braham on the door.\nAnd I'll do what I can to help get Iron in line. Smodur has...had a lot of supporters. They won't stand for this.\n And I don't blame them.\n Then let's get back to it.\nTalking to Rytlock:\n\nSmodur might've been an ass, but I'm not sure he deserved that.\n Ryland had the drop on us. It could've been worse. A lot worse.\nI guess, yeah. But if Smodur hadn't killed Cinder—\n We wouldn't be in this situation, I know.\n I'm not sure, either.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Furthermore, if going further to the north then to the east, one can get access to a huge area of water below the regular map and access to other areas by swimming (gaining credit for all areas on the way); logging out and in will cause one to return back on the ground in the corresponding area (tested to reach the Bloodcliff Quarry).",

      "strWikiText": "The Straits of Devastation is a high level zone in the Ruins of Orr. It straddles the Tyrian Mainland and the island nation of Orr. The events in the area focus on defending Fort Trinity and capturing the Temple of Balthazar, by moving pact reinforcements further into Orr. Three separate chain events are responsible for movement of the reinforcements to Rally Waypoint. Once at least one of the reinforcements has arrived, the Pact will start to rally towards the Altar of Betrayal. This triggers another chain of events, eventually leading to the capture of the Temple, the spawn of a Glorious Chest and the appearance of the Karma-merchant Tactician Deathstrider, one of the merchants in Tyria who sells Obsidian Shards.\n\n\n== Map completed ==\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Events ==\n  Clear the Pact field hospital of Risen (70)\n  Clear the

Here, Dagonet and several sylvari, aided by a handful of others, work to recover Orr after the fall of Zhaitan in honor of Trahearne. A few ghosts of Orrian royalty and handful of their servants have returned to this area, working to restore the Six Human Gods' reliquaries, hoping that such an act will speed up the recovery process and return Orr to its former glory.\nHowever the Risen still remain a persistent threat, now called \"Unchained\" by the sylvari who recognize the loss of an Elder Dragon master. Balthazar has visited the region recently, seeking access to both his own and Abaddon's reliquary, and having brought with him part of his mercenary army.\nSiren's Landing has a unique mode of transportation in the form of four shrines, indicated by , found in the four corners of the main landmass. Once one has purchased an Attunement Token for a shrine, they will have account wide usage of the shrine with no additional costs to when using it.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nLike most of the Living World Season 3 zones, Siren's Landing is not directly connected to neighboring areas. In order to reach it, one can use one of the following methods:\n\nUse a Siren's Landing Portal Scroll.\nBegin the mission On Orrian Shores—the third story step of One Path Ends—and use the  Ship east of Macha's Landing in Lion's Arch.\nUse a Teleport to Friend while having unlocked the area on the account, which requires having Episode 6 from Living World Season 3 unlocked first.\n\n\n== Map resources ==\n  Unbound Magic is found throughout the map and is dropped by various enemies and events.\n  Orrian Pearls can be gathered from Orrian Oyster nodes throughout the map and as event rewards.

      "strWikiText": "Divinity's Reach (sometimes shortened to just DR or the Reach) is the last bastion of human glory. White limestone walls, great statues, shrines to gods—Divinity's Reach is the world as it had once been, as it will be again. A tiered-city is laid out like a great wheel, with the high outer walls as its rim and six inner walls radiating like spokes from the hub at its center.\nMembers of all ethnicities of humanity live here, some of whom have been exiled or are unable to return to their homelands. Built on the northern shores Divinity Coast between Lake Doric and Lake Regent that were once part of the Greater Giant's Basin, it is a city sometimes described as a breathtaking monument of white parapets and high, pale towers. The royal family and The Ministry rule Kryta from here. It was built by King Baede, established in 1220 AE after the Rising of Orr flooded Lion's Arch the year before. It has become the bastion to human civilization and culture and is defended by the Seraph, Ministry Guard, and Shining Blade.\nThe city itself is made of heavy stone and mortar contrasting with the wilderness that surrounds the city. It was hastily built on a cliff's edge over a pre-existing underground crypts. The crypts, accessible primarily via Skull Plaza (though requires paperwork with the Seraph to access legally) but also open up to the northern cliffside (which prevents the stench from reaching the city during the summer), have been expanded since the city's establishment and are lined with bones of dead humans and even contains the tomb of Blimm within its depths.\nThe city is best described as a cultural melting pot, housing humans of Krytan, Ascalonian, Elonian, and—though seldom seen—Canthan and even Orrian descent, though the latter hide their heritage due to the dark history their homeland has. The city is circular in design and divided into six districts and the central palace. The Ascalonians, Elonians, and Krytans each have their own districts in the city, and there exists two commons districts which house the poorest as well as most of the stores and festival activities in the city. Canthans once had a district which also acted as the arts district, however a sinkhole formed and collapsed the district - which has recently been rebuilt as the Crown Pavilion.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Pets ==\nJuvenile Krytan Drakehound\nRurikton (Minister Wi's Estate)\nWestern Commons (In the center)\nJuvenile Pig\nOssan Quarter (At the farmer's market north of the armorsmith)\nEastern Commons (West of the orchestra)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nConcept art\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nHoliday loading screens\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThere was at one point a bug that caused one to fall under the map if they jumped into a hole in the Ossan District and reappear again in the Royal Terrace if they moved under it and relogged. A floor was added there to prevent players from doing this in a bug fix that was introduced in autumn of 2017.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nDuring development, Divinity's Reach contained a Canthan and Arts district similar to the Ossan Quarter and Rurikton and included a mix of Asian-style architectures. The district was removed late in development and was replaced with the Great Collapse. Map artist Josh Foreman has said that a lot of the development team would like to return to Cantha and encourages interested players to ask for a future Canthan region.\nInternally at ArenaNet, this area was known as \"Valley_Divinity.\"\nDivinity's Reach has young children wearing the names of GW1 Heroes in quotes and pretending to be their pseudonym-sake.\nIn the Cemetery you can find writings in New Krytan saying \"where my resurrect portal\".\nAround various places, posters with styllized New Krytan can be found saying \"stay the blade.\" They appeared around June 2016 at the same as the Current Events leading into Living World Season 3.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "strName": "Lion's Arch",
      "strWikiText": "Lion's Arch, the most diverse and cosmopolitan city in Tyria, is a melting pot where all races gather and trade. It owes no allegiance to any race or nation, but stands on its own—and does so by virtue of its active navy, its financial strength, the intelligence and cunning of its leaders.\nLion's Arch figures prominently in the game's storyline. One of the main themes of Guild Wars 2 is bringing together disparate, even opposed groups in order to fight a greater enemy: the Elder Dragons. Alone, no race will survive their awakening. Only together can the races of Tyria survive. Nowhere in Tyria is that belief more strongly held than the city of Lion's Arch.\nAs the cultural and economic hub, Lion's Arch serves as the central focus of holidays and festivities such as Halloween. During Halloween, Mad King Thorn walks the streets of Lion's Arch telling jokes, and the city is full of spooky, dark, and pumpkin decor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nLion's Arch went through multiple changes over the years since its days as the capital of Kryta in the original Guild Wars to its current incarnation as a free city in Guild Wars 2.\n\n\n=== City of Pirates ===\n\nIn 1219 AE, the Elder Dragon Zhaitan woke from its slumber. The Rising of Orr created a great flood which destroyed and completely submerged the old capital. The ruins of Lion's Arch were utilized as a safe harbor by ships looking to escape the horrors of the sea.\nA decade later, in 1230 AE, the wreckage of old Lion's Arch was slowly turned into a refuge for Corsairs and other pirates, smugglers, and other independent vessels. Shanty towns were created, and as the waters slowly receded, a settlement formed that owed no allegiance to Kryta. This settlement was unified by a human named Cobiah Marriner, who fought against the scourge of Orr alongside charr, asura, norn, and any other race that would lend their vessels to the cause. Out of that staunch and allied front, the city of Lion's Arch was reborn.\nFor generations, the people of Lion's Arch were on the front line of the war with Zhaitan, the dragon of Orr. Their city was destroyed, only to be rebuilt in defiance of the Elder Dragon's power. The elite Lionguard built a fortress on Claw Island, a small body of land in the harbor, in order to defend against Zhaitan's attacks. No ship sails from their docks without a wary eye south toward the dark waters of the undead. They live each day with the knowledge that they are a bastion against the destruction that the Elder Dragon would bring—regardless of whether or not the other nations of the world recognize, or care about, their ongoing struggle.\nFor decades, Lion's Arch has been run by the Captain's Council, a committee of wealthy merchants and sea captains. Those who wish to take an active hand in the city's governance must prove themselves regardless of their race and heritage. They must be respected as a noted ship commander, and they must have contributed to the city's growth or health. If they are seen as a leader in the city, then they may purchase one of the seats on the Captain's Council—when one becomes available. This system of political governance leads to a great deal of one-upmanship among the local captains and on the council itself.\n\n\n=== Battle for Lion's Arch ===\n\nIn 1327 AE, after months of preparation, the arch-villain Scarlet Briar descended on Lion's Arch with all of her deadly forces. The city was razed and the smoldering husk of the proud port city was occupied, and it was weeks before the siege was broken. After days of battle, Scarlet was slain in the skies above the city aboard her airship, the Breachmaker.\nWord of Scarlet's demise has spread like wildfire throughout the wards of the city. With renewed vigor, the heroes of Lion's Arch, the Lionguard, and Order forces have driven out the remainder of Scarlet's armies, their morale and ranks shattered. Cheers and celebrations erupted at the refugee camps and nigh across all of Tyria. All the while, the Breachmaker—the enormous airship looming over Sanctum Harbor—continued to drill uncontrollably before it mysteriously exploded a few days after hitting a magical leyline which was Scarlet's target. The resulting blast caused the pieces of the Breachmaker to be flung out across the city—mostly concentrated around the harbor but with debris landing as far out as the Farshore Ward and scarring the landscape. With the pieces being so immensely large, the resultant rebuilding of Lion's Arch was taking place around these seemingly immovable chunks of metal.\n\n\n=== New Lion's Arch ===\n\nLion's Arch finished its rebuild in 1328 AE. Parts of The Breachmaker were molded into new metal used to build several new structures, such as an aerodrome, a fortress, turrets, a new harbor with a shipyard amongst others. Several points of interest also had their names modified or replaced. The previously destroyed waypoint in Fort Marriner was restored and is now usable. Many citizens and services were moved including those for guilds that are now at Guild Initiative Headquarters.\n\n\n== Unique features ==\nLion's Arch is unique among the cities of Tyria since it is the central trade and cultural hub. It has features not found in other cities:\n\n Asura gates\nTo the capital cities of all playable races, located in Coriolis Plaza.\nTo far-flung destinations including Pearl Islet in Southsun Cove and Arborstone in Cantha, located in Coriolis Plaza.\nTo World versus World, located in Fort Marriner.\nTo Structured PvP, located in Fort Marriner.\nPortals exiting within or near each of the 3 Orders.

      "strWikiText": "Claw Island is a stony fortress near the mouth of Sanctum Harbor. When Lion's Arch was founded, a small defensive fortification was built there, designed to keep enemies from sailing close enough to bombard the city's docks. It was the crowning jewel of the protection Sykox Steamshroud had planned for Lion's Arch, and the charr was understandably proud of it. The fortress took years to complete, but when it was done, it guarded the mouth of the harbor, providing gunnery posts and defenses as well as early warning when the Dead Ships came in force as they'd done at Port Stalwart.\nThe island fortress withstood countless Risen assaults, never letting more than a handful of Risen through. However, in 1325 AE, the Risen launched a large-scale assault that was led by Blightghast the Plaguebringer, one of Zhaitan's strongest dragon champions. The island was overrun, and Lion's Arch was at its most vulnerable ever until the Orders — the forces that would become the Pact — counterattacked and retook the island. Two years later, Scarlet Briar bypassed Claw Island's defenses by launching a land and air assault.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nOnly accessible during The Battle of Claw Island and Retribution.\nAll Points of Interest become visited as soon as you first enter Claw Island.",

      "strName": "Southsun Cove",
      "strWikiText": "Southsun Cove is an island located southwest of Lion's Arch, in the Sea of Sorrows. Sometime after the defeat of Zhaitan, the Consortium representative Canach sent an expedition to the island to survey the island and build an asura gate, as part of the Consortium's development plans for making it a tourist attraction. The team used loopholes in their orders to study the flora of the island, and in turn provoked the native karka, who had settled the island recently when fleeing the horrors of the Unending Ocean. The karka followed the survivors of the team and attacked Lion's Arch, Garenhoff and the Caledon Forest. In response, the Lionguard led a counterattack to wrest control of the island, building roads, siege weapons and outposts along the way. Finally, the Lionguard took down the Ancient Karka, and the island was secured.\nWith the death of the Ancient Karka, the Consortium continued working to turn the island into a research and tourist attraction.

      "strName": "Crab Toss",
      "strWikiText": "Crab Toss is an activity introduced with The Secret of Southsun Living Story content that is loosely based on the guild challenge Southsun Crab Toss. Crab Toss can be played in Southsun Cove.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nOn those days that Crab Toss is active in the daily activity rotation, enter into a match by talking to:\nActivity Lead Cassi, the  activity NPC in Lion's Arch, located in the southern part of the Grand Piazza\nTalking to  activity NPCs in Lounges:\nEdinna Linhoft, onboard the Havoc's Heir (accessible with a Captain's Airship Pass)\nEla, inside the Champion's Rest (accessible with a Champion's Rest Pass (2 weeks))\nBaasim, in the Lily of the Elon (accessible with a Invitation to \"Lily of the Elon\")\nHawker Annika, in the Lava Lounge (accessible with a Lava Lounge Pass)\nSanctuary Krewe, inside the Mistlock Sanctuary (accessible with a Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey)\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\nPlayers are pitted into a free for all arena of 8 players. Each player gets skills to help them fight each other for control of a crab while avoid enemy karka. A Succulent Crab is thrown randomly into the arena by the Crab Toss Referee and the objective is to gain and hold the crab for as long as possible. One match lasts 6 minutes (plus 10 seconds cooldown from a match to another).\nKarka hatchlings spawn regularly and will chase after the crab carrier. However, their attack can hit nearby opponents as well. Players hit by them will lose health and gain either a cripple or blind debuff which can only be removed by dodge rolling or becoming downed. In addition, the longer a crab is in play, up to three veteran karka will spawn and begin rolling around the arena (First veteran spawns 35s after crab is first picked up, the next 35s after the previous spawned), instantly downing any player which does not evade them. Downed players will drop any item they carry and be disabled for a few seconds before being automatically revived with full health.\nThe crab can be knocked or thrown to the ground via player skills and also will fall to the ground if the crab carrier is downed. While on the ground, the crab can be killed by rolling karka or by karka hatchlings. If this happens, the large karka despawn, and the referee will throw a new crab into the arena.\nAt the end of the match, the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, only one of the top scorers is declared the winner.\n\n\n=== Scoring ===\nCrab Carry — Three points are rewarded every few seconds to whomever is holding the crab.\nDenies — Three points are rewarded for knocking the crab out of an opponent's hands.\nElimination — Three points are rewarded to the crab carrier every time an opponent is downed.\nGrabs — Three points are rewarded for stealing the crab.\n\n\n=== Skills ===\nDuring the match, bundles are thrown into the arena. Smashing open the crates reveals one object that may be used in the game. Items may be carried in the main hand, replacing skill slots 1 and 2 (some bundles do not have a skill for slot 2), or the off hand, adding a new skill in skill slot 5. A player can carry one main hand and one off-hand item at a time (the crab counts as a main hand item).\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n\nTop player\n  Splendid Chest\nParticipants\n  Chest\n\n\n== Achievements ==\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAll the karka attack the Succulent Crab (Or the player carrying it) only, so line your dodges up so they'll strike other players for you.\nYou can watch the Crab Toss Referee when the Succulent Crab is either dead or not in the field yet to see where it will go.\nWatch out for the Veteran Karka, they will use a rolling attack to instantly down players. You can use this to your advantage.\nIf you're surrounded, you can throw the crab onto the ground in front of you so nobody will steal it. The crab has similar throw mechanics to the keg in Keg Brawl.\nUse the boxes lying around on the ground to help you hold or gain the crab.\nOther players can see the traps made by the karka eggs. It's possible to place them inside a crate so the players won't notice and the crate is used as bait.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nCrab Toss Referee\nSettler\nSucculent Crab\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nChampion Karka\nKarka Hatchling\n\n\n== Objects ==\nAnchor\nCrate\nConch\nFishing Pole\nKarka Egg\nPlank\nSouthsun Punch\n\n\n== Ambient dialogue ==\nCrab Toss Referee: Watch out!\nSettler: (laughing)\nSettler: (cheering)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nCrab Toss was originally added temporarily for The Secret of Southsun release but it was subsequently made available permanently as part of the daily activity rotation in Queen's Jubilee.",

I'm Countess Anise-advisor, confidant, and protector of the Queen. Can I count on your help here today?\n Of course, Countess.\nBraham: I like this party. It's not quite a Cragstead moot, but Krytans definitely know how to stage a celebratory fight.\nRox: Sadly, we have to stop fighting for now.

What a monstrous traged— (laughs) Sorry, I just couldn't keep a straight face.\nQueen Jennah: Forgive the deception, Logan. Countess Anise's security measures depended on as few people as possible knowing about them.\nLogan Thackeray: I'm glad you're safe, but I'm your cap—a Seraph captain. How can I serve if I'm not informed?\nCountess Anise: Don't be petulant. My job is to protect the queen from her enemies. Yours is to seek out and destroy those enemies.\nCountess Anise: There were indications of a threat, so I concealed the real queen until it revealed itself. Now it has. And it's spreading.\nCountess Anise: Reports from all over the globe tell of portals releasing Scarlet's twisted minions. What are you doing about it?\nQueen Jennah: A fair question. Scarlet can't be allowed to complete whatever it is she's started, and she must be punished for the attempt.\nLogan Thackeray: Very well. Scarlet is the problem, and she's in the pavilion. If she's using portals to send things out, we use portals to send things in.\nQueen Jennah: Marshal whatever forces you need, Captain. Scarlet and her minions must be rooted out of that pavilion to face Krytan justice.\nCountess Anise: And do hurry. The sooner we get in, the sooner we rescue the VIP hostages. Poor Faren...who'd have thought he had hero in him?\nRox: What's the situation, Captain? Braham and I are ready if you need us.\nLogan Thackeray: I'd welcome the help. Scarlet's clearly been planning this for a long time, and she's several steps ahead of us.\nLogan Thackeray: We have to catch up. Fast. Our top priorities are to neutralize her minions and find a way into that pavilion.\nBraham: \"Neutralize\" means \"break,\" right? Because I can do that.\nLogan Thackeray: That'll work for her minions, but the door doesn't look breakable. We're going to need an alternative. Maybe portals?\nRox: I was talking to the asuran dignitary, Vorpp. He's an engineer with a background in asura gates and teleportation equipment.\nLogan Thackeray: Perfect. See if he's ready and willing to help. In the meantime, I'll organize Seraph patrols to protect the streets.\nRox: So, Vorpp: we need a way into Scarlet's playhouse. Ready to put your thaumo-technical skills to use on behalf of DR?\nEmissary Vorpp: Of course. I know of this Scarlet. She earned advanced engineering degrees at each of Rata Sum's colleges in record time.\nEmissary Vorpp: \"Engineering prodigy,\" they said. \"Intuitive grasp of phenomenological design and transcendent systems.\" Pfah, I say. Pfah!\nEmissary Vorpp: I hate a show-off, especially when they're showing me up. Count me in. Taking down Scarlet is a matter of asuran pride.\nRox: Asuran pride and human survival. Now let's put our heads together and figure out a way into that pavilion.\nSpeaking to Vorpp\nWhile inside her lair, Scarlet's able to launch remote attacks using teleportation technology. I believe that I can reverse-engineer her portals to gain access to her lair, with your help.\n How can I help?\nScarlet's minions first attacked Gendarran Fields, near Ascalon Settlement. If you forget what to do next, use the communicator to contact me.\n On my way.\n Did you learn anything about Scarlet that might help us?\nI know she got special dispensation to study at all three Rata Sum colleges. She excelled, too, that leafy little know—it—all.\n So she's asura-trained?\nAsura-, charr-, norn-, and even hylek-trained, if you believe the stories. All I know for sure is that she claims to have seen the Eternal Alchemy, and to understand it...which is patently false.\n Why is it false?\nBecause nobody ever \"sees\" the Eternal Alchemy. That's like claiming to see the shape of the universe, or to understand how reality works. If it's beyond every asura genius, it's beyond her.\n How can I help?\nYou can gather some data for me at the site of Scarlet's first portal invasion. Once you're there, get in touch with me using this holo-communicator.\n Where should I go?\n Did you learn anything about Scarlet that might help us?\n Understood.\n Thank you for the information.\n How can I help?\n How can I help?\n I'll think about it.",

      "strWikiText": "The Grove is the sylvari capital located within the Tarnished Coast. It is situated at the base of the massive Pale Tree and is formed from her network of roots and branches.\n\n\n== History ==\nHundreds of years ago, the Grove was the site of a human village, amongst whom was a Shining Blade member by the name of Ronan. Ronan, a soldier and a warrior, went out to war, and in his travels came across a cavern full of seeds the size of a man's fist. With one of those seeds stowed away, Ronan arrived back home, only to find that the villagers, including his daughter and the rest of his kin, had been massacred by mursaat. In grief, Ronan made a vow of non-violence and planted that seed upon the graves of his family. It was this seed, tended by Ronan and the centaur Ventari in a small sanctuary until their passing, that would later become the Pale Tree that anchors the Grove today.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Pets ==\nJuvenile Fern Hound\nReckoner's Terrace\nRonan's Bower\nScholar's Terrace\nJuvenile Pink Moa\nRonan's Bower\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nMaps\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nConcept arts\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nAlthough mechanically counting for the Maguuma Explorer, in lore it is part of the Tarnished Coast.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Grove shares many parallels to Ventari's Refuge in that it was founded on values of peace and mercy, and that it is also the location of a gargantuan tree.\nMuch like the sylvari themselves, The Grove underwent a major redesign very close to the release of the game. In total, The Grove has gone through 3 different iterations.\nThe original appearance of The Grove can be seen on the video that explains the redesign of the sylvari. Guild Wars 2 - Growing the Sylvari (From Guild Wars 2's official YouTube)\nThe second version of The Grove is much similar to the final third version, the live version, but several elements were cut out from it. Some of these changes were the removal of several sunflowers, a sylvari fountain, the recoloring of the leaves of the Pale Tree from soft yellow to pink, and, most importantly, a complete redesign of the plant-staircases and bridges that connected the different levels of The Grove. This second appearance of The Grove can be seen in the video introduction to the sylvari race. Guild Wars 2 - The Home Soil of the Sylvari (From Guild Wars 2's official YouTube)\nThe Gate Assistant and Gate Engineer converse about why the Gate Engineer's golem runs away after the Gate Assistant asks it a some questions.  The questions are a reference to Leon's interrogation at the Tyrell Corporation by Holden in the movie Blade Runner.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nThe official Home of the Sylvari trailer.",

When the Great Destroyer drove them from their homes in the Depths of Tyria 250 years ago, they arrived at the ruins of some previous civilization, setting up geomystical generators for power within these already fortified confines and establishing the area as their new capital. The aesthetic sensibilities of these ruins are reflected in modern asuran architecture.\nOriginally a hastily erected outpost protected by ruins, Rata Sum is now a geometrical masterpiece and testament to the asura's unstoppable ability to progress.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nAfter creating an asura character, you will appear in the beginner map, Metrica Province.

The area seems finished, but inaccessible. Invisible walls block the way to it.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nInternally at ArenaNet, this area was known as \"Wetland_Complex.\"\n'Rata Sum' is an anagram of 'Mursaat'.\nRata Sum translates roughly from Latin to \"I have thought/considered\".\nThose who attempt to go where they aren't intended to, such as under the cube or the dam to the south, will be transported to a Peacemaker jail cell.\n\n\n== References ==",

This imbalance in power terrifies me.\nPeacemaker Officer (1): I certainly hope there isn't any precipitation in the immediate forecast.\nPeacemaker Officer (2): Afraid you'll melt?\nPeacemaker Officer (1): My latest golem upgrade isn't watertight. I'm not entirely certain what will happen if they get wet.\nRetired Researcher (1): What's happening on the council these days? Why do they give the Inquest so much rope?\nRetired Researcher (2): Inquest simply knows how to play the system. They're smart and slippery.\nRetired Researcher (1): Why, when I was on the council, we could discern truth from chicanery.\nRetired Researcher (2): Funny, I remember you funding a slew of failed weather-control experiments.",

I need your aid!\nGavin: Well done, sapling! Oh, well done, indeed.\nUpon finding Gavin in the cave (cinematic):\n\n<Character name>: Be at ease. You're safe now. Are you wounded?\nGavin: I am―but I can't let that hinder me. I'm looking for a white stag. If I let it escape, the consequences will be...dire.\n<Character name>: Then we have something in common. I'm also looking for the white stag. Have you seen it?\nGavin: It was here, but it fled to the eastern woods before I could catch it―and then the undead arrived.\nGavin: You have done me a good turn, and you seem strong and swift. If we hunt together, we might have more luck.\n<Character name>: I'd be glad to work with you. Let's begin our hunt at once.\nTalking to Gavin:\n\nGavin: Watch your back. The undead are relentless. Discussion can wait.\n We'll leave together. I'll guard you!\nWhile leaving the cave:\n\nGavin: We must leave this area. It's too dangerous to remain.\nGavin: My wound weakens me. I need to catch my breath.\nUpon talking to Gavin after leaving the cave (cinematic):\n\nGavin: If we do not find it soon, the undead will―and they'll tear it apart. We must keep looking. We must.\n<Character name>: You need to rest, Gavin. You were badly wounded. We'll keep going, but not to the point of risking your life.\nGavin: My life means nothing compared with finding the stag. Still, you are right. I'm of little use to you like this. I shall seek healing, and meet you near Caer Verdant when my health has improved.\n<Character name>: That is the wisest course of action. The stag is a wild animal and a creature of the Dream. It will survive for a while on its own.\nOn speaking with Gavin after escaping the cave:\n\nGavin: I know we'll find the stag now that we're working together.\n Why did you come out here?\nAstorea villagers told me the stag was in the area. I thought I could track it down.\n I'd like to ask another question, if you don't mind?\n An elusive beast, but it can't evade us forever.\n You're badly injured, Gavin. Do you need to rest?\nYes, I noticed. After I find a mender, I'll meet you at Caer Verdant.\n I'm glad. May I ask another question?\n I'll meet you there. Farewell.\n Why did you want to find the stag?\nThe stag is a manifestation of the Dream, symbolizing hope. It could do so much for us, if we could only capture and tame it.\n I absolutely agree. We'll find it, I promise.\n Take care, and I'll meet you at Caer Verdant.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\nPrevious text\nYou helped the residents of Caledon Forest.\nA white stag has been seen in the Verdence. Just like in my Dream! I must find out what this means.\nSylvari are spreading the tale of a white stag roaming the Caledon Forest. I dreamed of such a stag! He may be elusive, but I believe I can find him.\nWhile looking for the legendary white stag, I came upon a hunter named Gavin. I rescued him from trouble, and he offered to help with my quest.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Objective and dialogue changes ===\nBefore the September 2014 Feature Pack, there was an extra objective and dialogue at the beginning to talk to the Warden Requisitioner.\nHelp the residents of Caledon Forest.\n\nSpeak with the Warden Requisitioner, and acquire your gear.\nSpeak to Warden Arondele.\nSpeaking to Warden Requisitioner\nAh, a freshly awakened sylvari! Welcome to Tyria, sapling! I'm a member of the Wardens, the protective guard of our homeland here in the Grove. I'm here to provide you with equipment.\n Oh, good. In my dream, I had a certain attire...\nI've just the thing for you. Here, take this. Now, go speak with Warden Arondele, down the path to your left. She'll help you get oriented.\n Thank you very much!\nSpeaking to Warden Requisitioner again\nThis will suffice for now. You can find better equipment during your travels and purchase it from merchants throughout Tyria. Good luck!\n Again, thank you. You've been very helpful.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe tracks of the White Stag look like those made by horseshoes, not the cloven hoof of deer.",

The garden will be back to normal in no time.\n Good luck, Warden.\n Whatever you say, Warden!\nCinematic when speaking to Caithe:\n\nCaithe: I knew we'd meet again, young Valiant.\n<Character name>: You know that because you saw it in the Dream. What else do we dream that comes true?\nCaithe: Much. But not always what you might expect. Why? Is something troubling you?\n<Character name>: Somewhat. In my dream, a champion in brilliant green armor defeated all challengers. He seemed invincible, yet a small mouse nipped at his heel.\n(If Cycle of Dawn)\nCaithe: Aife, you are born of Dawn, like this Valiant. Can you interpret the vision?

Show me!\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nCaithe: The trouble's this way, Valiant.\nCaithe: This \"brute\" could be the foe you seek. Hurry!\nTalking to your luminary:\n\nLuminary: First we need to see what the commotion is about. Then we can talk.\n I'll go see what the problem is.\nUpon reaching the Green Knight:\n\nDagdar: Please! Enough. Victory is yours. Just let him live!\nBercilak: Live! Ha! This sapling accepted my challenge and failed. His life is forfeit.\nEladus: Please, Dagdar. Go, and leave me. He'll kill you too, if you stay.\nDagdar: You're a monster, Bercilak. I won't let you do this! I won't live without my beloved.\nBercilak: So be it. As Ventari teaches, \"Hard ground makes stronger roots.\"\nTalking with the NPCs present:\n\nCaithe: I see your dream was a warning. There stands a knight in green.\n I can't let the green bully harm anyone else. He must be stopped.\nIndeed. But now what. Confront him?\n That's exactly what I plan to do.\n I need to get to the bottom of this.\nDagdar: That green knight is horrible. He's going to kill Eladus! Please, can you help me?\n Wait, who are you two?\nMy name is Dagdar, and Eladus is my beloved. I can't let that monstrous green knight hurt him anymore!\n Don't worry. I'll help you.\n Why is the green knight so angry?\nBercilak is a bully. He challenges young sylvari just to be cruel, and now he's gone too far! I beg you, don't let him kill my love.\n I'll take over from here, sapling.\n I'll take over from here, sapling.\nEladus: Please, don't let Dagdar fight that monster...I was trying to keep him safe...\n I'll protect you both. Don't be afraid.\nCinematic when talking to Bercilak:\n\n<Character name>: A knight in full armor—attacking defenseless innocents? That isn't right. Why don't you fight me instead?\nBercilak: I'd love to. I've killed many in my quest to find the exceptional individual who can defeat me. (chuckle) I doubt you're it, but we'll fight anyway.\nTalking to the NPCs in between the fights:\n\nEladus: For the Pale Tree!\n I'll beat that bully yet.\nDagdar: Oh, Mother Tree, watch over us!\n Don't worry. I'm not finished yet!\nUpon defeating Bercilak:\n\nDagdar: You did it, Valiant! You killed him!\nBercilak: Don't be so sure.\nUpon defeating Bercilak again:\n\nCaithe: Be cautious. I have a bad feeling about this...\nBercilak: What a waste of time! Come, slay me once more, Valiant. I can do this all day!\nUpon defeating Bercilak a third time:\n\nBercilak: A Valiant! Ha! Good try, but you're no match for me, weed.\nBercilak: You did well enough that I'll leave you alive—for now. But I'll be back.\nBercilak: The next time we fight, try to make it a real challenge...or I'll make sure to finish what I started here today.\nAfter Bercilak leaves (cinematic):\n\nDagdar: My deepest thanks. Eladus is everything to me. Your courage saved us both.\n<Character name>: Who was that knight in the green armor? I saw him in my Dream, before I awoke. I recognized him as easily as if we had met before.\nDagdar: Bercilak. He's terrible! He challenges young sylvari to duels and then fights them to the death. When Bercilak insulted my honor, Eladus had no other option. He loves me, after all.\n<Character name>: That sounds like a cat taking advantage of mice. He's prideful, and he's a bully. He deserves to be taught a lesson full of bruises.\nCaithe: That's it! The meaning of your Dream. Like mice, young sylvari fight Bercilak with no hope of winning. But you are different Valiant. You can do more that just throw yourself on his claws.\nDagdar: Perhaps I can help you, after all! Bercilak is wooing a Valiant named Gairwen—unsucessfully, I might add. She's been seen near Morgan's Spiral.\n<Character name>: That is helpful, Dagdar. Thank you. I'll visit Gairwen and ask for her story. Perhaps Bercilak told her a weakness I can use.\nSpeaking with your allies:\n\nCaithe: Three times you defeated him, and three times he stood once more. This is treachery of the worst sort.\n How did the green knight keep getting up?\nI would guess it was some foul magic, likely of the Nightmare Court.\n Can you tell me more about the Nightmare Court?\nThey're the evil that cast the blight into your dream. You overcame it there. You can do so again.\n I'll try. Can I ask another question?\n If they don't fight fairly, I'll just have to work harder. Thanks for the information.\n If this is part of my Wyld Hunt, how will I know when it's complete?\nYour Wyld Hunt is to defeat the dragon—that's what we saw in your dream. This is merely a step along the path.\n I see. I'm gaining the wisdom I'll need by facing other enemies first.\nThe Elder Dragons are powerful. No one expects you to face one when you are so new to the world. Be patient. Enjoy life. That time will come, soon enough.\n May I ask another question?\n I will be ready.\n What's the story with Dagdar and Eladus?\nThey're a young couple, and very much in love.\n In love?\nLove is a gift...and a burden. We sylvari love freely, as our hearts command. There is no shame in it.\n May I ask another question?\n Thank you for explaining.\n Do you know this Gairwen they mentioned?\nThe name is vaguely familiar. I believe she's recently suffered some tragedy, but I don't remember more.\n Good information. Can I ask you something else?\n I'll find out for myself. Wish me good luck!\n How were you able to reenter the Dream to help me?\nThe Mother Tree sent me. Her power is great, and she exists both here and in the Dream. Still, as I am awake, I could only do so much.\n So you needed me to help you?\nExactly. We hoped we would find someone with the heart of a hero. And there you were, <character name>.\n May I ask another question?\n I am glad that I could aid the Pale Tree.\n Sounds like I have a task, I'll be on my way.\nDagdar: I can't thank you enough. My love is injured, but safe! We owe you our lives.\n What started the fight?\nWe were having a picnic when Bercilak arrived. He said terrible things, things Eladus couldn't ignore, even though I begged my love to walk away.\n Did the green knight challenge Eladus?\nYes, and my beloved accepted. I was so frightened! He is not as skilled as you, and Bercilak cut him down.\n I see. May I ask another question?\n It's over now. Take care of each other.\n Why were you fighting that monster unarmed? He would've killed you.\nI couldn't leave Eladus! We Dreamed of one another. To be in a world without Eladus would've hurt worse than death.\n You should have both run away.\n That green knight was ferocious. Are you both all right?\nWe are, but I thank the Pale Tree that you were nearby. Your courage saved us.\n Stay away from Bercilak, and spread the word about him. I'll look into this.\n I'm glad I could help. True love is a noble cause.\nYou are kind, Valiant. My love and I will never forget your good deed.\n It's interesting. My Wyld Hunt also showed early. Best of luck to you both.\n The danger's gone now. Take care of each other.\nEladus: Thank you. He was so cruel to Dagdar! I knew I couldn't beat him, but I couldn't ignore it any longer.\n Why did you accept if you knew you couldn't win?\nIf I hadn't, Bercilak would have attacked us both. It was the only way to protect my beloved.\n You are a brave and true love. Rest easy. I'll handle this.\n You're welcome. I hope you recover swiftly.\n(If Cycle of Dawn)\nAife: You did well, Valiant. You chose the honorable road with no guidance. I am impressed.\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe constantly grow. I awakened as the sun rose on the first dawn of our race. I am an archer and a traveler, but now I stay here and help others.\n Have you traveled to many places?\nOh, yes-Lion's Arch, the Maguuma Wastes, the great desert... The world is wider than you can dream, valiant.\n How wonderful. May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Dawn?\nWe awakened during the early morning hours. We are diplomats, wanderers, and seekers. You are of our cycle, Valiant.\n I'm happy to be a member of the Dawn. May I ask another question?\n This explains my urge to travel! Thank you.\n What about the other cycles?\nNoon, Night, and Dusk? They each have their own strengths and interests.\n How curious. May I ask another question?\n Thanks for the explanation.\n What makes our time of birth so significant?\nDreams change with the hours. Someone's cycle can show us their true strength.\n Very interesting. May I ask another question?\n Thank you for the information.\n Thank you, Firstborn.\n(If Cycle of Noon)\nNiamh: You have done well. You fought hard and refused to surrender I am impressed.\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe are visionaries. I awakened at the zenith of the first day of our race. I am a warrior and a defender, and I founded the Wardens.\n I've seen Wardens in the Grove. Can you tell me more?\nThe are honorable friends. Protecting the Grove from any who would harm the sylvari or the Pale tree.\n How wonderful. May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Noon?\nWe awakened during the heat of the day. We are adventurers, daredevils, and soldiers.

I am impressed.\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe are always adapting. I awakened as the sun first sets on our race. I am a scholar and an architect, and I shaped the Grove in the shadow of the Pale Tree.\n What do you mean, you shaped the Grove?\nI am a shaper, someone who grows our houses and roads. I began by shaping the Grove, and have overseen its growth since.\n How wonderful. May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Dusk?\nThe Cycle of Dusk awakened during the evening. We are artists, crafters, and entertainers. You are of our cycle, Valiant.\n I'm happy to be a member of the Cycle of Dusk. May I ask another question?\n I am here to see the beauty in the world.

I am impressed.\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe are always learning. I awakened on the first night of the sylvari race. I am a philosopher a mathematician, and a watcher of the world.\n What do you mean by watcher of the world?\nI predict the evolution of events. For example, I see that you will be a force of change in Tyria.\n How wonderful. May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Night?\nWe awakened during the dark of night. We are mathematicians, scoundrels, and sentinels.

If we hurry, we could catch up to it.\n<Character name>: That watchtower over there gives me an idea. From the top, we can get the lay of the land and possibly a glimpse of our quarry.\nGavin: You have a true hunter's instincts, Valiant. That's exactly what we should do.\nGavin: When the stag appears, we shall give chase until it tires.

Occasionally, one of the undead slip past our watch, and we have to find them before they get into the forest.\n Why? Would that be a bad thing?\nGoodness, yes! Just one of those foul creatures could cause a great deal of corruption if it ran amok through the Caledon.\n Makes sense! May I ask another question?\n That would be a problem. Good luck!\n Thanks for the information. Farewell.\n We're tracking a white stag. Have you seen one in this area?\nI haven't spotted it myself, but I heard that it's roaming the forest.

Outpace me if you can!\n Off we go!\n With your tracking skills, we'll catch the stag in no time.\nYou're absolutely right. We make a splendid team!\n On to the hunt!\n Go gently. Do not frighten the creature. We'll win this game in time.\nIndeed we will. Stay near me, and we'll see if we're stalwart enough to catch him.\n An excellent plan. To the hunt!\n So we shall!\nWhile chasing the white stag:\n\nGavin: Step lightly. We cannot alert the stag to our presence.\nGavin: It flees! Now, to the hunt!\nGavin: Keep after it!\nGavin: The beast is beginning to tire!\nGavin: Maintain the pursuit! Soon, we shall have him!\nGavin: The last efforts of a weary beast. We are winning!\nGavin: Victory! The white stag is ours!\nCinematic upon capturing the white stag:\n\nGavin: Excellent work, Valiant. But now I must leave. And I will be taking the white stag with me.\nGavin: You're welcome to come, of course. Your skills as a hunter would an asset to the court.\n<Character name>: The Nightmare Court? Who are they, and what are you doing? Gavin, the stag must go back to the Grove. Caithe is waiting for us there.\nGavin: No, my noble friend. The white stag is coming with me. Once we turn it to the Nightmare, the stag will be a powerful weapon against the Dream.\nGavin: It is a manifestation of hope and faith. In Nightmare, it will be just the opposite — a creature of despair and hatred.\nGavin: Through its power, the Pale Tree will be freed of the chains forged by Ventari's Tablet.\n<Character name>: A weapon? Gavin, this is wrong. The white stag is a peaceful creature. You can't turn it into something cruel.\nGavin: I can. We can. Come with me. You would be celebrated. Possibly even knighted by the grand duchess herself!\n<Character name>: No, Gavin. I'll never join the Nightmare Court.\nGavin: Ah, that's a pity. It grieves me greatly to turn predatory into prey, Valiant, but I cannot have you interfere. Farewell.\nOn getting attacked after the cinematic:\n\nGavin: It's a shame. A loyal friend, and now a debased death.\n\n\n=== Dreamer's Terrace ===\nOn approaching Caithe:\n\nCaithe: I am here, Valiant.\nTalking to Caithe (cinematic):\n\n<Character name>: Caithe! I need your help. Gavin, the hunter working with me to track the white stag, has betrayed me. I don't understand what he's done.\n<Character name>: He said something about using the stag as a weapon and that Ventari's Tablet was evil. He said he was a member of the Nightmare Court.\nCaithe: The Nightmare Court? Thorns! You were right to come to me. They believe that Ventari's Tablet has turned the tree away from the original nature of the Dream.\nCaithe: They embrace pain and darkness, and they claim that Ventari's lessons have corrupted the sylvari-and the Pale Tree.\n<Character name>: Corrupted us? Can't they see that they're the ones who become poisonous?\nCaithe: They believe their own lies. Come, Valiant. We must discover where the court is holding the white stag.\n<Character name>: I agree, but how?\nCaithe: News of such a prize will have spread among the courtiers like wildfire. We will go to Aron's Woodlot, and spy upon the court.\nCaithe: They often go there to recruit new courtiers, but we must be subtle, or they will flee without telling us anything. Meet me there, and we will devise a plan.\nTalking to Caithe (non-cinematic):\n\nCaithe: I should have known that the Nightmare Court would be interested. If we don't rescue the white stag, they could do serious harm.\n Can you tell me more about the Nightmare Court?\nMisguided sylvari who claim Ventari's Tablet \"restrains\" us. They turn their backs on the guidance of the Mother Tree.\n Why would anyone do that?\nThey believe that the tablet is a lie that has wrongly influenced the Tree. They reject the teaching of other races and intend to force nightmare on the rest of us.\n What do you mean, \"embrace nightmare\"?\nThere are dark corners in the Dream: traumatic memories, evil impulses. They say that is our true nature, and they do as much evil as possible in order to fill the Dream with such things.\n I dislike them already. May I ask another question?\n Thank you for explaining. I'll be on my guard.\n Gives me the creeps just to think about it.\n Why would the Nightmare Court want the white stag?\nThe stag is a creature of the Dream. The court wishes to pervert the Dream to nightmare. It would be an excellent gateway to achieving that end.\n How awful. May I ask another question?\n Horrifying. Meet at Gleaner's Cove. We'll stop them together.\n We should move quickly, then. Farewell.\n\n\n== My story ==",

The attack will begin very shortly afterwards. The first wave consists of spiders and jaguars; they will enter the room from two directions. The second wave contains a kennelmaster who has brought a pack of thorn wolves. The remaining wave consists of courtiers. When prompted to do so, approach Sariel, who is standing on the staircase in the room to the north (Caithe needs to speak with her, so be sure to walk far enough up the ramp to tow Caithe to Sariel).\nSariel begins talking to Caithe, but suddenly encourages Gavin to strike you while your backs are turned. Gavin however is a more honourable member of the court and wishes to fight the player fairly in a duel, with the winner taking the stag. Duel Gavin - he wields a mace and uses the associated Guardian skills, so avoid standing in the Symbol of Faith, and damage him through his blocks and regeneration. If you are partied with others, then they are given the following supportive skills that inflict boons and conditions. \n\nSpeak with Caithe for the closing cinematic for this instance.\nTravel to the Omphalos Chamber to receive the final cinematic for the mission from the Pale Tree - she tells you that you will fight Zhaitan, the dragon of Orr.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nSylvari\nAvatar of the Tree\nCaithe\nLuminary of the character's cycle:\nAife\nKahedins\nMalomedies\nNiamh\nMender Aine\nMender Glyndowr\nSylvari Warden\nWarden Ranger\nWarden Scout\nWounded Sylvari\nAnimals\nWhite Stag\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nNightmare Court\nGavin\nNightmare Courtier\nNightmare Court Jaguar\nNightmare Court Kennelmaster\nNightmare Court Spider\nNightmare Court Thorn Wolf\nNightmare Hound\nSariel\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\n\n=== Dreamer's Terrace ===\nAt the beginning:\n\nCaithe: Valiant! Quickly, to me!\nSpeaking with the Luminary of your cycle:\n\n<Luminary name>: Excellent work. Even in the short time the white stag has been in the Grove, many ailing sylvari have recovered.\n Fantastic! And are you helping with the defense? (if Aife)\n Great news! Are you here to help with the defense? (if Niamh or Kahedins) [verification requested]\nYes. While you fight off the Nightmare Court, I'll stay here and guard the stag. Fair fortune, Valiant <character name>.\n Thank you, Firstborn.\n I'm glad to hear that. Farewell.\nSpeaking with Mender Aine:\n\nMender Aine: Are the Nightmare Court really going to attack us here?\n We'll keep you safe.\nSpeaking with Mender Glyndowr:\n\nMender Glyndowr: Thank the Mother Tree, you found the white stag!\n We did, but the danger isn't over. Stay here and we'll defend you.\nSpeaking with Wounded Sylvari:\n\nWounded Sylvari: Valiant! They say you're the one who rescued the white stag. I just know his presence will help me to heal.\n Stay here with the mender. You need your rest.\nSpeaking with Caithe:\n\nCaithe: Well met, Valiant. The wardens are on edge—the court gathers just outside the Grove. We have little time.\n What should we expect?\nHm. Do you feel those tremors? I think the Nightmare Court's getting...creative. Be on guard.\n I'm ready to protect the white stag. For the Dream!\n Is there any way the court could get a force this far into the city? (Honorable) only appears if you have a Dignified personality\nNever underestimate nightmare.\n What should we expect? (leads to above)\n Who's more likely to lead the attack, Sariel or Gavin?\nIt could be either—or both. Sariel would come in chaos. Gavin can be more dangerous—he'll actually make a plan.\n I'll be on the lookout. Can I ask another question?\nAfter speaking with Caithe:\n\nCaithe: Wardens, prepare for an attack.\nSylvari Warden: Here they come!\nSylvari Warden: Hold fast against the foe!\nDefending against the Nightmare Court:\n\nNightmare Kennelmaster: Surrender the white stag! The Nightmare Court demands it!\nNightmare Courtier: The white stag will be ours!\nSylvari Warden: Turn back, or suffer the consequences!\nNightmare Kennelmaster: Nightmare cannot be denied! Give us the stag, and we might spare you.\nNightmare Kennelmaster: Nightmare will devour you!\nNightmare Courtier: Destroy them! Take the stag and destroy them!\nAfter defeating the first waves of the Nightmare Court:\n\nCaithe: We must find Sariel. Once she's defeated, their courage will fail, and the courtiers will flee.\nApproaching Sariel:\n\nCaithe: Poor Sariel. Did you really think you could just walk into the Grove and take the stag?\nSariel: No, Caithe. I also planned on leaving you in a pool of your own blood. And, well, here you are.\nCaithe: Even Faolain couldn't tame that temper of yours. Let's see if my blades can do better.\nSariel: Strike now while their backs are turned!\nGavin: Where's your honor? We aren't cutthroats or animals. We kill when needed, when we can use that bloodshed to grow a garden.\nGavin: Now, leave. Meditate on this, and should you fail to learn, I'll kill you myself!\nSariel: This isn't over, Caithe! One day I'll kill you, no matter what the Grand Duchess says!\nCinematic with Gavin:\n\nGavin: My friend, I apologize for Sariel's behavior. She's young. She hasn't learned to temper power with wisdom.\n<Character name>: What is there to understand? The Nightmare Court is evil. It's destructive. You and Sariel are two of a kind.\nGavin: You wound me. I am nothing like Sariel. She is an honorless craven, and I have been your friend.\nGavin: The court doesn't seek to destroy either the sylvari or the Pale Tree. We're trying to free you from the influence of Ventari's Tablet.\n<Character name>: You want to use the white stag to corrupt the Dream. You would turn this beautiful creature into a weapon!\nGavin: Yes. For the greater good. Let me prove that the Nightmare Court has honor. Duel me. For the winner, the white stag. For the defeated, death.\n<Character name>: Very well, Gavin. I accept your challenge and your terms. Let's begin.\nApproaching Gavin after the cinematic\n\nGavin: I will fight you with honor, Valiant. Let all assembled bear witness.\nDuring the duel:\n\nGavin: Excellent, Valiant—but I am not yet overthrown.\nGavin: Well struck! Now, it's my turn!\nGavin: Your skills are as keen as your honor, Valiant. Let us end this.\nGavin: Well done, Valiant. I am beaten. I will be remembered...in the Dream.\nAfter the duel:\n\nCaithe: Thank the Tree that's over.\nCinematic after the duel:\n\nCaithe: Victory! The Nightmare Court will not try this particular tactic again.\n<Character name>: Now the white stag will be safe.\nCaithe: For now, but soon enough, the court will find another way to draw the Dream into darkness. Faolain loves to cultivate misery.\n<Character name>: It sounds like you have history with the court and this Grand Duchess Faolain. Will you tell me the tale?\nCaithe: I knew her once...but I don't know her anymore. What matters is that you've done well, Valiant. Enjoy this moment.\nCaithe: Come. One image in your Dream has been resolved, but the other—the dragon—remains to be deciphered.\nCaithe: Our Mother wishes to see the white stag, and I intend for you to be there as well. It is time you met the Pale Tree.\n<Character name>: I'd be honored, Caithe. I'll see you there.\nSpeaking with Caithe:\n\nCaithe: Well fought, Valiant. The Court won't try that again. The stag is truly safe.\n Caithe...who is Duchess Faolain?\nShe was once dear to me, but I lost her. Anyway, no use dwelling on memories. We are needed now.\n As you say.\n Is there anything I should know before I meet the Pale Tree?\nShe is the mother of our race. Treat her with respect, and know that she loves all her children.\n I'll remember that.\nSpeaking with the Luminary of your cycle:\n\n<Luminary name>: Congratulations on your victory. Your bravery will save many lives, Valiant.\n Caithe said I'm to meet with the Pale Tree. Why can't we do it here?\nIt's rare, but the Pale Tree can manifest an avatar within the Omphalos Chamber. You should be honored to speak with her!\n I will, Firstborn. Thank you.\n Thank you, Firstborn.\nSpeaking with Mender Aine:\n\nMender Aine: Are you all right? Is anyone hurt? What happened?\n We won the day. The Nightmare Court won't return—you'll be safe now.\nSpeaking with Mender Glyndowr:\n\nMender Glyndowr: Magnificent! I've never seen someone so brave.\n That's kind of you to say.\nSpeaking with Wounded Sylvari:\n\nWounded Sylvari: I heard the fighting! What happened?\n It's over. The Nightmare Court has retreated. Are you feeling better?\nMuch better, thank you. The white stag's presence in the Grove soothes my mind. The horrors plaguing me are receding into the Mists...\n I'm glad to hear that. Rest, and know peace.\n You'll be safe, now.\n\n\n=== Omphalos Chamber ===\nFinal cinematic upon approaching the Avatar of the Tree:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Greetings, my valorous child. The white stag spoke to me of your deeds. I'm so proud of you.\n<Character name>: I'm honored to meet you, Mother Tree. I knew I had to protect the stag—I saw it in my dream. Is that because of you?\nAvatar of the Tree: No, dear heart. I do not control the Dream. I am simply its caretaker.\n(Luminary present depends on cycle)\nAife: If you will it, Mother, the stag can stay in our garden. There, he could run free.\nNiamh: If you will it, Mother, the white stag can stay in our garden. We would be glad to defend it from any who dare wish it harm.\nKahedins: If you will it, Mother, the stag can stay in our garden. There, it can see the sky and enjoy both music and song.\nMalomedies: If you will it, Mother, the stag can stay in our garden. There, it can take its ease in the shadows, free from the dangers it has braved.\nAvatar of the Tree: An excellent suggestion. He will be very happy there and often reunited with his defender.\n<Character name>: If I may ask, Mother-in my dream, I also saw a fierce, horrible dragon. I've been told it is my Wyld Hunt to face this monster. Is that true?\nAvatar of the Tree: I fear that it is. A Wyld Hunt is a sacred thing, a burden placed by the Dream upon the strongest and bravest of my children.\nAvatar of the Tree: In your Dream, you fought an Elder Dragon face-to-face. Only two of my children have had such a dream. You, and Caithe.\nAvatar of the Tree: All sylvari fight the dragon's servants, the undead, but I believe you will face Zhaitan itself. I also believe you will prevail.\n<Character name>: I understand, Mother. Thank you.\nAife: Be proud of your victory, Valiant. For now, rest. The new dawn will bring new adventures.\nNiamh: Be proud of your victory, Valiant. Until battle comes once more to challenge you, may you be at peace.\nKahedins: Be proud of your victory, Valiant. Spend your leisure in learning, and in well-deserved joy.\nMalomedies: Be proud of your victory this day, Valiant. But remember, peace is short-lived. You will be needed again—likely, very soon.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Caithe, I wish for the Valiant to meet my eldest child.\nCaithe: Trahearne has returned from Orr? Mother, is that wise?\nAvatar of the Tree: Do not question the Dream. We must all play our parts.\nCaithe: Yes, Mother Tree. I will see that it's done.\nSpeaking with the Avatar of the Tree:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: I am so very proud of you, my child. This is only the beginning.\n Are you really the tree I see all around me?\nIndeed, but I have manifested in this form so that you and I may speak.\n I am glad to meet you, Mother.\n What can you tell me about Zhaitan?\nIt's a powerful force of evil. You have already fought its undead minions on our shores.\n Caithe and I both dreamt of fighting this horror. Will that come to pass?\nYou are destined to fight for Tyria's future. Zhaitan will be the largest of many obstacles.\n May I ask another question?\n I will do my best, Mother Tree.\n Did you know that I would rescue the white stag?\nNot exactly. But I knew that you could. That is the inspiration of the Dream.\n May I ask another question?\n What an interesting perspective. Thank you.\n I heard you talking about Trahearne. What else do you know about him?\nHe is another of my firstborn. His Wyld Hunt, like yours, concerns the land of Orr.\n How very interesting. May I ask you something else?\n I look forward to meeting him. Thank you.\n Thank you, Pale Tree. I am at your service.\nSpeaking with Caithe:\n\nCaithe: You have done well, Valiant. We will make a formidable alliance against Zhaitan someday.\n Can you tell me more about Zhaitan?\nThe undead dragon at the heart of the cursed land of Orr. Only two living creatures have ever seen him: myself and my brother Trahearne.\n Can you tell me more about Trahearne?\nAnother of the firstborn. His Wyld Hunt also draws him to Orr, though he did not dream of fighting the dragon.\n What did he dream about, if not battle?\nIn his dream, he saw Orr as a beautiful land, once more green and fresh...an impossible task. Dragon corruption cannot be cleansed.\n Is there such a thing as an impossible Hunt?\nYes. A hunt you do not survive.\n I...see. May I ask you another question?\n Chilling. Thank you for the wisdom.\n I'll have to think about that. Thank you.\n You've seen Zhaitan? What...what is the monster like?\nLarger than you can imagine, and ceaselessly hungry. It is death beyond compare. Ask me no more.\n I understand. Can I ask about something else?\n Thank you for telling me.\n Can I meet Trahearne?\nYes. I sent him word of your Dream. He's already on his way to the Grove.\n That's wonderful. I look forward to meeting him. Thank you.\n Thank you. That's all I need for now.\n Thank you for your confidence in me, Firstborn.\nConversing with the Luminary of your cycle:\n\n(if Cycle of Dawn)\nAife: I am proud of you, Valiant <Character name>. This was a difficult task, but you have proven yourself stalwart.\n Can you tell me more about the Pale Tree, please?\nThe Pale Tree is mother to all sylvari. That golden form is a manifestation of the tree itself.\n If she's not sylvari, what is she?\nTo our knowledge, she is unique in all of Tyria. A truly wondrous creature. She guides us and shepherds the Dream.\n We are fortunate to have her. May I ask something else?\n Thank you for the information, Firstborn.\n What can you tell me about the dragon?\nThey appeared before sylvari came into the world. The dragons are evil, and wish only destruction.\n There's more than one dragon?\nYes. Primordus, Zhaitan, Jormag, Kralkatorrik[sic]...each has awakened, bringing terrible destruction across the world.\n May I ask another question?\n We have a lot to do to make Tyria safe. Thank you, Firstborn.\n What do we know about Zhaitan, in particular?\nHe is a rotting shell, an undead dragon, and he sits at the heart of Orr—a dark, cursed land across the sea.\n May I ask another question? [sic]\n Sounds chilling. Thank you, Firstborn.\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe constantly grow. I awakened as the sun rose on the first dawn of our race. I am an archer and a traveler, but now I stay here and help others.\n Have you traveled to many places?\nOh, yes—Lion's Arch, the Maguuma Wastes, the great desert...the world is wider than you can dream, Valiant.\n How wonderful. May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Dawn?\nWe awakened during the early morning hours. We are diplomats, wanderers, and seekers. You are of our cycle, Valiant.\n I'm happy to be a member of the Dawn. May I ask another question?\n That explains why I have the urge to travel! Thank you.\n What about the other cycles?\nNoon, Night and Dusk. They each have their own strengths and interests.\n How curious. May I ask another question?\n Thanks for the explanation.\n Thank you, Firstborn.\n(if Cycle of Noon)\nNiamh: An excellent beginning, Valiant <Character name>. You will do well in Tyria.\n Can you tell me more about the Pale Tree, please? (Same as above)\n What can you tell me about the dragon? (Same as above)\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe are visionaries. I awakened at the zenith of the first day of our race. I am a warrior and a defender, and I founded the Wardens.\n I've seen wardens in the Grove. Can you tell me more?\nThey are honorable friends, protecting the Grove from any who would harm the sylvari or the Pale Tree.\n How wonderful. May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Noon?\nWe awakened during the heat of the day. We are adventurers, daredevils and soldiers. You are of our cycle, Valiant.\n I'm happy to be a member of the Cycle of Noon. May I ask another question?\n That must be why I love exploring! Thank you, Niamh.\n What about the other cycles?\nDawn, Night, and Dusk. They each have their own strengths and interests.\n How curious. May I ask another question?\n Thanks for the explanation.\n Thank you, Firstborn.\n(if Cycle of Dusk)\nKahedins: Excellently done, Valiant <Character name>. I'll be watching your career carefully. I expect great things out of you!\n Can you tell me more about the Pale Tree, please? (Same as above)\n What can you tell me about the dragon? (Same as above)\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe are visionaries. I awakened as the sun first set on our race. I am a scholar and an architect, and I shaped the Grove in the shadow of the Pale Tree.\n What do you mean, you shaped the Grove?\nI am a shaper, someone who grows our houses and roads. I began by shaping the Grove, and have overseen its growth since.\n How wonderful. May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Dusk?\nWe awakened during the evening hours. We are artists, crafters, and entertainers. You are of our cycle, Valiant.\n I'm happy to be a member of the Dusk. May I ask another question?\n I am here to see the beauty in the world. Thank you.\n What about the other cycles?\nNoon, Night, and Dawn. They each have their own strengths and interests.\n How curious. May I ask another question?\n Thanks for the explanation.\n Thank you, Firstborn.\n(if Cycle of Night)\nMalomedies: You were the fulcrum of great change, <Character name>. You have questions?\n Can you tell me more about the Pale Tree, please? (Same as above)\n What can you tell me about the dragon? (Same as above)\n What's it like to be firstborn, like you and Caithe?\nWe are always learning. I awakened on the first night of the sylvari race. I am a philosopher, a mathematician, and a watcher of the world.\n What do you mean by watcher of the world?\nI predict the evolution of events. For example, I see that you will be a force of change in Tyria.\n Well, I can't wait for that! May I ask another question?\n Fascinating. Thank you, Firstborn.\n Thank you for answering my questions.\n Can you tell me more about the Cycle of Night?\nWe awakened during the dark of night. We are mathematicians, scoundrels, and sentinels. You are of our cycle, Valiant.\n I'm happy to be a member of the Night. May I ask another question?\n That explains why I'm so interested in seeing the world.\n What about the other cycles?\nNoon, Dawn, and Dusk. They each have their own strengths and interests.\n How curious. May I ask another question?\n Thanks for the explanation.\n Thank you, Firstborn.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Once inside, talk to the bad guy about what a rebel you are, and how you stole a key from the guards.\nOnce he is convinced that you are bad too, examine the jail vine with the yellow writing on it. Use the key to open it. You'll gain a vine for a weapon, as your regular ones were taken by the guards.\nKill the wardens and leave the jail area, where Caithe will confront you. You will regain your normal weapons. Attack Caithe and \"kill\" her.\nRenvari will be so impressed that he will tell you that the Nightmare Court will meet near Aaron's Woodlot. Then he runs off by himself.\nRevive Caithe and tell her about where the Nightmare Court meeting will be.

We must make Renvari talk!\nCaithe: Calm yourself. Since the Wardens cannot sway him, we will use cunning.\nCaithe: When the Valiant arrives, I will explain.\nWhen you approach Caithe (cinematic):\n\nTiachren: The Wardens have had no luck convincing Renvari to tell us what he knows. If he doesn't talk soon, we may never find Ysvelta.\nCaithe: It's time to try something new. We'll take you into the jail as prisoners and place you in the cell with Renvari.\nCaithe: I will give you a key to the cell. Tell Renvari that you stole it from the Wardens, and make your escape.\nTiachren: In the cell with him? Caithe, he's a psychopath; that's too dangerous. There must be another way.\nCaithe: He's one sylvari. There are two of you. The only way to gain Renvari's trust is to convince him that you're kindred spirits.\n<Character name>: I'm willing to try. Do you think that pretending to be prisoners is enough to get him to confide in us?\nCaithe: No. Renvari must also believe you are potential converts to the Nightmare Court. Therefore, during your jailbreak, you will kill me.\n<Character name>: What? That's not funny, Caithe.\nCaithe: It isn't meant to be a joke. Don't worry, young dreamer. You play your part, and I'll play mine.\nOn the way to the cell:\n\nCaithe: Follow me. Act oppressed.\nTalking to your allies:\n\nTiachren: This plan frightens me, but for my love's sake, I'll play villain.\n It's the only way. Stay close and do as I do.\nCaithe: Hush, prisoner, hush!\n Wha—huh? Oh, right!\nWarden Guard: Move along, prisoner. Hurry to your cell.\n Are you seriously guarding skritt?\nYou bet your roots I am! Beastly little things snuck into the Grove and tried to steal the Ventari tablet.\n No! How did they even get up there?\nThe silly beasts stepped onto the lift and got stuck. They kept riding up and down, yelling, \"Flying! Flying!\"\n I don't envy your job.\n Right. On my way.\nWarden Guard: Get in there, prisoner. You get what you deserve, sharing a cell with Renvari!\n I'll be fine.\nWarden Guard: More troublemakers? Put them in the thorns.\nWarden Guard: Don't get too close to Renvari. I've heard he can kill you with a touch of his hand.\nCaptive Skritt (1): Grrr. Jail! I hate it.\nCaptive Skritt (2): When do we leave?\nCaptive Skritt (1): We don't! We stay! That's what's bad.\nCaptive Skritt (2): When do we leave?\nCaptive Skritt (1): Grrrrrr.\nTiachren: I'm not sure the Mother Tree taught me a word that expresses how awful this place is.\nRenvari: Ah, Caithe. Come to set me free?\nCaithe: Not likely. Enjoy prison, Renvari. You'll be here for a very long time.\nWarden Guard: So, that's the famous criminal, Renvari. Huh. He doesn't look twelve feet tall.\nAfter being put in the cage:\n\nWarden Guard: I'm watching you. No funny business.\n Wouldn't dream of it.\nTalking with Renvari (cinematic):\n\nRenvari: This cell's hardly big enough for one, and I've got two idiots clogging it up now? Ugh.\n<Character name>: We're not idiots; we just got careless. Next time, that blighted Caithe won't be so lucky.\nRenvari: She caught you, too?\n<Character name>: Yeah, but she won't have time to brag about it. I palmed a key from the guard. We're getting out of here.\nRenvari: Nicely done, I'll admit. But what about the guards? You won't last two minutes against the Wardens.\nTiachren: Are you afraid? Look, friend, if you want to stay here, feel free. I thought the Nightmare Court were supposed to be tough.\nRenvari: You could be trying to convince me to break out just so the Wardens have an excuse to cut me down.\nRenvari: It's going to take more than taunts to convince me.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nWarden Guard: What's so scary about that nightmare courtier, anyway? Looks normal to me.\nPrompt after the cinematic:\n\nRenvari: You two talk a big game, but I'm not convinced. Have you done anything that would impress me?\n Set fire to a few houses. I like to watch them burn.\nAh, yes. Those watermelon huts are just begging to be turned into a blaze.\n Ready for me to bust us out yet?\nAll right, let's see what you can do. Get that door open.\n Watch and learn.\n Made up reasons to duel, just to kill off weaklings.\nHa! Now that's low. I approve.\n Are you ready to bust out of here yet, or do you still mistrust me?\nAll right, let's see what you can do. Get that door open.\n Watch and learn.\n Me? What about you, you sniveling courtier? You should justify yourself to me!\nVicious! Aggressive! I like you already.\n Ready for me to bust us out yet?\nAll right, let's see what you can do. Get that door open.\n Watch and learn.\n Stole low-hanging fruit from a sapling.\nThat's all? Pathetic. The wardens must be as bored as I am.\n Wait, that's not all I've done!\nInserting the key into the lock:\n\nJail Cell Vine: The vine has grooves that might fit a key.\n Insert the key and turn.\nThe vine slackens. Another tug will open the door...and the vine would make a handy weapon.\n Open the door and start some chaos!\nEscape:\n\nRenvari: Splendid. Good riddance to this wretched place!\nWarden Guard: Renvari's gotten out of his cell! He'll kill us all!\nWarden Guard: Wardens! Raise the alarm! Renvari's escaping!\nWarden Guard: Renvari's free! Somebody do something!\nRenvari: Farewell, fools!\nCaithe: Stop and surrender, prisoners!\nRenvari: Not this time, Caithe!\nTiachren: Watch out! We're dangerous folk. Very dangerous, indeed.\nTiachren: We are tremendously vicious and cruel. Wouldn't you say so?\nAfter defeating Caithe\n\nRenvari: By the tangled roots! You killed a Firstborn!\nCinematic:\n\nRenvari: You killed her! I'm impressed. The Nightmare Court will welcome you both as heroes.\n<Character name>: You presume that we can make it out of here alive. Once the Wardens discover our escape and Caithe's murder, they'll be after us.\nRenvari: Then we split up and divide their efforts. After we lose them, we can regroup. There's a camp northwest of Aron's Woodlot. Meet me there, and we'll celebrate your victory with our Nightmare brethren.\n<Character name>: Looking forward to it. I've wanted to meet the Nightmare Court for a long time. I'll see you soon.\nGetting Caithe back up (cinematic):\n\n<Character name>: Caithe? Are you all right? Renvari fell for the whole thing, just like you said he would.\nCaithe: You did well, my friend. I have the bruises to prove it.\nTiachren: You were both astonishingly brave. You risked your lives, just to help me save Ysvelta. I'm in your debt.\nCaithe: The risk was necessary. We needed information, and now we have it.\n<Character name>: Renvari told us where the Nightmare Court is meeting. They'll be keeping the prisoners in their camp.\n<Character name>: I'm sure Ysvelta will be glad to see us. We'll free her and escape the camp together.\nCaithe: I hope you're right. We shall see.\nTalking to Tiachren:\n\nTiachren: You're a blessing, Valiant. We shall swoop in, save my love, and all will be well once more!\n Don't be too sure. Anything could've happened to Ysvelta.\nYsvelta is strong. Nightmare's cruelty could never seep into her lovely heart.\n We'll see. I'll meet you at the camp.\n I saw your shield in my Dream. If anyone can save her, it will be us.\nYour attitude is refreshing. Caithe is nothing but doom and gloom.\n I'll meet you at the camp.\n I'll hope for the best.\n\n\n== My story ==",

She tells you to go to Annwen beach and talk to Carys. There may be an event in this area where angry hylek take over Annwen village, and some hang around close to the mission marker. Care might be required.\nYou find Carys on the beach, she has just planted three seed mortars. You may want to stay close to the mortars, because you are about to be attacked by several waves of Risen undead. Carys has a big hammer and is a pretty good fighter too. She will revive herself should she die between waves.\nAfter some waves of undead, Carys will warn you that undead are trying to flank you, and lead you over a hill to another part of the beach. There are some mine seeds on the ground here which you could pick up and plant if you are fast. To plant one, pick it up, then choose the type of mine plant you want, from 1 to 3, and point the targeting marker where you want the plant to grow.\nSeveral waves of Risen will attack. The final boss undead is a veteran brute with a big hammer. He can hit pretty hard.\nAfter you beat him, talk to Carys. The Valiant will decide that the krait must have kidnapped Carys's friend Tegwen. The next mission involves going to rescue her. This requires underwater combat, so make sure you get a good underwater weapon and practice with it to unlock the skills before starting the next mission.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\n\n\n==== Dreamer's Terrace ====\nSylvari\nCaithe\nTrahearne\nBlath\nMender Aine\nMender Glyndowr\nValiant Caoin\nTiachren\nWarden Ranger\nWarden Scout\nBanker\nCitizen\nFarmer\nMerchant\nMiner\nWorker\nWyld Hunter Valiant\nSylvari Balinora Generic Lines\nAmbient creature\nFrog\nSalmon\nSparkfly\nPlant\nSylvan Hound\n\n\n==== Quetzal Bay ====\nSylvari\nCarys\nCitizen\nWarden Captain\nWarden Ranger\nWarden Scout\nWarden Shield\nLionguard\nAnimal\nPink Moa\nJuvenile Pink Moa\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nRisen\nRisen Brute\nRisen Plague Carrier\nRisen Thrall\nVeteran Risen Brute\nSkale\nRidgeback Skale\n\n\n== Objects ==\nBoulder\nMine Seed\nMortar Seed\nSpikeroot Fruit\nVine\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\n\n=== Dreamer's Terrace ===\nWhen approaching Caithe and Trahearne:\n\nCaithe: At last you return from Orr, brother. What news?\nTrahearne: Zhaitan's power is growing, and the Risen carry its corruption throughout Tyria.\nCaithe: As I feared. We must be ready...ah, here comes the Valiant.\nCinematic with Caithe and Trahearne:\n\nCaithe: Greetings, Valiant. I want you to meet Trahearne, another of the sylvari firstborn.\nCaithe: Only a few of the firstborn have Wyld Hunts. I am one. Trahearne is another. I believe he carries the heaviest burden of us all.\n<Character name>: More difficult than fighting an Elder Dragon?\nCaithe: Our task is tangible, if dangerous, young Valiant. His is ephemeral...there may be no solution.\nTrahearne: I'm glad to meet you, Valiant, but I'm afraid we have no time for proper welcomes. There is a more immediate matter at hand.\nTrahearne: Warden Tegwen patrols the beach at Annwen, destroying the Risen that wash in from Orr. We exchange many letters on the subject.\nTrahearne: Her last missive was written during a recent storm, and mentioned an Orrian artifact she'd seen wash up on the beach.\nTrahearne: Tegwen said she intended to retrieve it—but since then, I've heard nothing. I fear for her safety.\n<Character name>: I'd be happy to go and look for her, Trahearne. If she's in trouble, I'll lend her a hand.\nCaithe: Good. It will be useful for you to see what we are fighting, Valiant. Orr is growing stronger, day by day.\n<Character name>: I'm ready to witness the dragon's corruption. I'm not afraid.\n<Character name>: As soon as I know more about what's happened to Tegwen, I'll contact you.\nSpeaking with your two allies:\n\nCaithe: Thank you for aiding us, Valiant. Tegwen is an excellent warden. Her disappearance puts lives at risk.\n What can you tell me about Tegwen?\nShe's a clever strategist, an exemplary member of the Cycle of Dusk. A fighter and a scholar.\n Where was she seen last?\nShe guards the beach by the Hamlet of Annwen. Her partner, Carys, is still in the area.\n Don't worry. I'll find her.\n Don't worry. I'll find her.\n I won't let you down. Farewell!\nTrahearne: Thank you, <Character name>. I appreciate your help. If there's anything you need to know, you have but to ask.\n I'm curious. Can you tell me more about your Wyld Hunt?\nI am challenged with cleansing the land of Orr. In my dream, I saw it green and growing again.\n Wow. That will be very difficult. Can dragon corruption be reversed?\nI don't know...but I must try. Every day it feels more overwhelming, but I refuse to give up hope.\n Can I ask you something else?\nAsk. I'll do my best to answer.\n I'm curious. Can you tell me more about your Wyld Hunt?\n What can you tell me about Tegwen?\n Did Tegwen tell you anything about the artifact?\n Actually, I'll head out now. Thanks.\n I understand. I'll do my best to find Tegwen.\n Can I ask you something else? (Leads to same lines as above)\n I'll think about that. Thank you, Trahearne.\n What can you tell me about Tegwen?\nShe is so insightful. When Orrian artifacts wash onto our beach, we have many discussions.\n Was she just curious about them?\nIndeed. I've become something of a mentor to her, and we share our information.\n Can I ask you something else?\n You speak very highly of her. I'll do my best to find out what happened.\n Can I ask you something else?\n I'll do my best to find her. Thank you.\n Did Tegwen tell you anything else about the artifact she found?\nSadly, no. Only that she'd seen something unusual on the beach, and when the storm was over, she'd seek it out.\n Can I ask you something else?\n I'll find her, I promise.\n Thanks for your help. I'll do my best to try and find Tegwen.\nOther NPCs:\n\nMender Aine: Hail, friend. I make salves for the wardens. They fight so hard to keep the Grove safe, It's the least I can do.\n That's very kind of you.\nMender Glyndowr: Sorry, I'm very worried about this ranger. Finding a cure for his ailment requires all of my attention.\n What's wrong with him?\nInfected wound from fighting the Risen on our shores. I'm sorry...please, just leave me to my work.\n Good luck finding a cure. I wish you well.\nWarden Ranger: The Risen monsters plaguing our shores just keep coming. We sylvari may not turn into undead, but we can easily die to their corruption.\n I'm sure the menders will help you. Get some rest.\nTiachren: Hail, Valiant. I'm too full of melancholy at the moment. Perhaps we could speak another time?\n Of course. Be well, Tiachren.\n\n\n=== Quetzal Bay ===\nWhen approaching Carys:\n\nCarys: One more seed plant—there we go. Perfect.\nCinematic before the battle:\n\nCarys: Teg—oh! You're not Tegwen. Thorns and brambles, where is she?\n<Character name>: I'm looking for Tegwen, too. A firstborn sent me to check on her. Who are you?\nCarys: My name is Carys. Tegwen and I are both Wardens here in Annwen. We're supposed to protect the beach, but I can't—oh, no! The Risen are coming!\nCarys: Please, stranger. Help me keep those monsters off the beach! We'll talk after!\nTalking with Carys:\n\nCarys: Hurry! Plant as many seeds as you can!\n I'm on it.\nDuring the battle with the undead:\n\nCarys: Hold your ground. The undead are approaching!\nWhen the marker on the map moves:\n\nCarys: They're trying to flank us! Over here!\nCarys beckons to <Character name>.\nFurther battle lines:\n\nCarys: Stay strong! We almost have them!\nCarys: Yes! They're all dead! Well...really dead this time!\nCarys cheers for <Character name>.\nCinematic after the battle:\n\n<Character name>: Very well, Warden Carys. The beach is safe again. Now, what can you tell me about Tegwen?\nCarys: She's my very good friend and my mentor. She was teaching me how to be a good Warden, but now she's missing, and I'm all alone.\n<Character name>: Calm down. When did you last see her?\nCarys: Five nights ago, when a storm hit the village. We were at the watchpost. Tegwen spotted something flashing like bright starlight, down on the beach.\nCarys: She went to investigate the next morning, as soon as the storm ended. Tegwen was gone before I woke up. She never returned.\nCarys: I searched and searched, but there was no sign of her. I know she's not dead! If she'd been killed, I would have found her remains.\n<Character name>: That's true if she was attacked by undead, but what about krait? They occasionally take captives.\nCarys: Krait? Oh, pollen powder, I hadn't thought of that. I was concentrating on the Risen!\n<Character name>: There are krait to the south, on Kraitbane Island. I bet those cold-hearted snakes kidnapped her.\n<Character name>: Leave behind a wall of seed-plants to guard the village and meet me at Kraitbane Island. We'll find Tegwen.\nTalking to Carys after the cinematic:\n\nCarys: You're wonderful! I'm so glad we worked together.\n You can call me <Character name>. You did very well, yourself.\nYou're so brave! Tegwen's always telling me not to be so brave. Tells me to look before I leap, even when I'm standing still.\n Speaking of Tegwen, can I ask you something?\nAbsolutely. Ask me anything, <Character name>! I'm an open leaf.\n You said you know Tegwen. Was she your partner?\nMentor, more like. She's very kind to me, and teaches me all sorts of things. We defend this beach together.\n Can I ask you something else?\n Can you tell me more about Tegwen?\nShe's my best friend. When I woke from the Dream, the undead were attacking. Tegwen threw me a sword so I could defend the Grove.\n Can I ask you something else?\n That's one way to wake up.\n Have you seen many krait in this area?\nOh, yes. All the time. They're awful creatures; they take slaves and they eat people! We have to stop them before they hurt Tegwen.\n I have another question, if you don't mind.\n You're right about that, Carys.\n What's it like to be a warden in Annwen?\nIt can be boring. Still, the people in the village are very kind, and someone has to keep the beach clear. right?\n Can I ask you something else?\n You're doing a very good job.\n Thanks for your time, Carys.\n She sounds like a good partner, watching out for you.\n I enjoy killing undead. Krait'll be a nice challenge, too.\nYou're so fierce! We're going to get along just fine. Just point me at those krait, and we'll tear them apart!\n Right! Can I ask you something?\n You got it.\n My name is Valiant <Character name>, pretty flower. I'm at your service.\nOh my, a Valiant! And you're so nice. So...uh...want to go kill things together? Is that how this goes?\n Plenty of time for that later. Can I ask you something?\n Something like that.\n Me too. Take care.\n\n\n== My story ==",

      "strWikiText": "A Vision of Darkness is part of the personal story for sylvari characters who have selected Act With Wisdom as their favored teaching and chose Carys's plan in Mirror, Mirror.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nHelp Trahearne rescue Tegwen from the cursed Orrian mirror.\n\nMeet Trahearne at the Pale Tree in the Grove.\nActivate the mirror.\nTravel through the mirror, into Orr.\nLocate Tegwen.\nGuide Tegwen through the portal.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\nClick here to edit the reward data\n\nAll professions\n2,808 \n  Spirit Shard\n  Thorny Seed Pouch (Basic)\n  Signet Ring of the Grove\nProfession-specific\n   Arborist Coat, Duty-Bound Duffers\n   Evergreen Coat, Ragamuffin Toeshoes\n   Snapdragon Coat, Homespun Espadrilles\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nGo to talk to the Pale Tree and Trahearne. They will open the portal in the mirror for you and Carys to travel to Desmina's Hallows in Orr. You start in the top corner of the map. At the bottom is the green oval with your objective. The obvious way to go is straight down that tunnel. As you go down the tunnel there will be various zombies to fight along the way. These are not much challenge. At the end of the tunnel in the green oval is a large group of zombies. The group includes plague bearers with their deadly explosions, and brutes with their deadly hammers. There are also pirates who have grenades and can set you on fire. You may want to try to pull out one or two zombies at a time to fight. Make sure you stay inside the mission area. The green oval goes outside the area.\nAfter beating the zombies, you can find Tegwen hidden under some wood behind some barrels. Talk to her and she will call Carys a dummy for getting trapped in the mirror too. Then you can bravely step in and rescue everybody. Lead Tegwen and Carys back up the tunnel to where you came in. There will be large groups of spider hatchlings, but you should be able to beat them easily. Once you get back to the portal, you go back to the Pale Tree, who will give you a coat and some other stuff.\n\n\n=== Notes ===\nEven though the objective states that you must guide Tegwen through the portal, you must do so by returning to the portal on the main floor of the instance, thereby eliminating a series of foes that spawn on your return trip. If you choose to instead return by remaining above the path on ledges/cliffs etc. and do not eliminate the wave of foes, the cut-scene will not be triggered upon your return to the portal and you must restart the instance.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nSylvari\nAvatar of the Tree\nCaithe\nCarys\nTegwen\nTrahearne\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nRisen\nRisen Brute\nRisen Plague Carrier\nRisen Pirate\nRisen Thrall\nRisen Spider\nRisen Spider Hatchling\n\n\n== Objects ==\nDead Hand\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nUpon arrival at the Pale Tree in the Grove:\n\nCarys: Tegwen!

Carys told us what happened.\nTrahearne: I've been studying the mirror, but the magic is beyond me. If we are to rescue Tegwen, we will need the Pale Tree's help.\nCarys: Please help me, Mother! Tegwen is my friend. I'm lost without her. She taught me how to be a Warden...she taught me everything.\nCarys: I know that I'm not very smart, but she's always been good to me. I can't let her be trapped forever in such a horrible place.\nCarys: My best friend is in terrible danger. I wish she was back in the krait cage!\nAvatar of the Tree: Have courage my child. The mirror's magic is not unknown to me. Tegwen is still alive, though she is very far away.\n<Character name>: Don't lose hope, Carys. Tegwen needs us to be brave.\nAvatar of the Tree: Well said. Hope is more powerful than any weapon. It is a light in the darkness; a star to lead us home.\nAvatar of the Tree: To rescue her, you must step through the mirror into Orr and find Tegwen there. Trahearne and I will keep the portal open so that you may return.\nAvatar of the Tree: Hurry, Valiant. If Zhaitan's servants discover the portal, they could use it to enter the Grove. I cannot allow that.\n<Character name>: I understand, Mother. We will be swift.\nOpening the portal:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: So much darkness. So much evil. How long can Tyria survive, with this blight upon her soul?\nAvatar of the Tree: The mirror's enchantment is powerful. Be brave, my children. I am with you.\nCaithe: Go. I'll stay and defend this side of the portal. Should any of the Risen try to enter the Grove, they will meet my blades.\nTalking to your allies:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Quickly, my child. The portal is unstable. I can't keep it open for long.\n I'll be as swift as the wind.\nTrahearne: We'll hold this portal as long as we can. Find Tegwen! Do not delay!\n I will!\nCaithe: Hurry! If Zhaitan learns of this gateway, he could send minions into the Grove.\n Really? The portal works both ways?\nYes, that's why this is such a risk. But a necessary one. We cannot leave Tegwen to die in Orr.\n Agreed. See you soon.\n I'm on my way. Travel well, Caithe.\nCarys: After you, <Character name>! I'm too nervous to go through first. I'll watch your back, just like I watch Tegwen's.\n Just stay close.\nSearching for Tegwen in Desmina's Hallows:\n\nCarys: We've got to find Tegwen. Please, Pale Tree, let her be safe.\nCarys: So this is Orr? It's so... dead. I've never seen anything so dead!\nCarys: Is that a giant sea urchin? A giant...undead...sea urchin? Is nothing sacred?\nWhen the Dead Hands pop out of the ground:\n\nCarys: Ah! What are those things? This place is horrible!\nAs a Risen Thrall and Risen Pirates spawn:\n\nCarys: Look out!\nCinematic with Tegwen:\n\nCarys: Tegwen! I thought we'd never find you. I thought Zhaitan was going to chew you up and eat you!\nTegwen: Carys, you came after me—again! Did you touch the mirror, too? What were you thinking?\nTegwen: At least I knew you were safe in the Caledon Forest. Now we're all trapped here.\n<Character name>: We're not trapped. Trahearne and the Pale Tree are keeping the mirror's portal open, but there isn't much time.\n<Character name>: If we hurry, we can escape Orr and arrive safely in the Grove.\nTegwen: You're not kidding? We can go home? Thank the Mother!\nTegwen: Carys, you crazy brave girl, stay close to me. Orr is not the kind of place that tolerates mistakes.\nTegwen: Swiftly, Valiant—lead the way!\nReturning to the portal:\n\nTegwen: Hurry! We've go to get out of here before Zhaitan finds us!\nCarys: There! That's the valley where we started! The portal must be close!\nCarys: Oh, thank the Pale Tree! Let's get out of this rotted place.\nCarys: I don't think they watered this place very well...\nTegwen: They did Carys.\nTegwen: This place...I'll never forget how hollow it feels.\nTegwen: I saw eyes in the darkness. Great glowing eyes that cut into my soul.\nTegwen: There's the portal! I hope we get there in time - I want to go home!\nNear the portal:\n\nCaithe: It's been too long. I'm going in after them.\nTrahearne: Look! Just beyond the suface[sic] of the mirror, there's a ripple. It might be them.\nTrahearne: Yes, there! I see the Valiant. I think I can make out Tegwen and Carys, too.\nAvatar of the Tree:[sic] Have courage, my children. You are almost home.\nCinematic back in the Grove:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Safely home! Now, Trahearne, close the portal, and we shall all be safe once more.\n<Character name>: Thank you, Mother. I speak for us all when I say we're glad to be home.\nTegwen: That place was foul. Cold and hopeless—like a murdered soul. I can feel its chill in my spirit.\nAvatar of the Tree: Be at peace, my daughter. You're safe now, and soon, the warmth of the Grove will cheer you.\nTrahearne: Stay near the Pale Tree for a while, little sister. In time, your spirit will heal again. Trust me. I know this well.\nAvatar of the Tree: The dragon's corruption is a blight that sickens the heart. If we do not stop Zhaitan, the entire world will wither and die.\n<Character name>: I understand what you mean now, Mother. We cannot allow the dragons to exist, even if it costs us our lives.\nAvatar of the Tree: Valiant, I am proud of your courage and your conviction.\nAvatar of the Tree: Though you have seen horrors, you now understand our greatest weapon against them - hope.\n<Character name>: Thank you, Mother Tree. I will think on this. When you need me again, I will be ready.\nUpon completion:\n\nCarys: Come, you've been through too much. Let us return to Annwen.\nTegwen: I don't know if I can face the undead. My visit to Orr has shaken me.\nCarys: Then I'll hold the beach while you find your footing.\nTegwen: And when did you become such a fierce Warden?\nCarys: You taught me well.\nTalking with allies again:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: I am grateful to see you safe under my boughs and branches. Yet one day, I know you will return to Orr. I hope it will not be soon.\n Can you tell me more about Orr and the mirror?\nIt's a foul place, and the mirror is a dangerous artifact... but we may need it someday.\n What will happen to the mirror now?\nIt'll be kept safely away until the time comes when, perhaps, we'll find a way to use it against Zhaitan.\n That is good to hear. Thank you, Mother Tree.\n Ah, yes, my Wyld Hunt. Thank you, Mother Tree.\nTrahearne: I know Orr. I know the devastation you have seen. It haunts my mind, day and night. I am sorry that you must bear that image.\n My Wild Hunt is to face the dragon. Better I know now what that means.\nThat is true. And you are not alone. Caithe's hunt is akin to yours — so is my own. There are others, as well, among all the races.\n What others?\nThree powerful orders fight against the dragons: the Vigil, the Durmand Priory, and the Order of Whispers. You'll learn more about them eventually.\n I hope so.\n I hope so.\n I understand you a bit better now, Trahearne.\nCaithe: I see you are unharmed, and with both Carys and Tegwen. An exceptional job.\n I tried to hurry. Tell me, did any of those monsters come through into the Grove?\nThankfully, no. You were quick, and we were all very lucky.\n I'm just glad it worked. Now let's put that mirror away — and never touch it again.\n Thank you, Caithe.\nTegwen: Valiant—you are my salvation. I never would've made it home without you, even if the horrors of that place are now seared into my mind.\n Get some rest, Tegwen. Try to find peace.\nCarys: That place was like a horrible nightmare! I hope I never go back there again. Not ever!\n It's all right. Tegwen is safe. It's over. Try to relax.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Larra will be at her console. She will say that she will open a portal to Orr to get Tegwen back. However, she warns that once the portal is open, she will have no control over what comes through the portal.\nShe will operate her console, and bright blue beams will shoot out in an area in front of the console, and at the top of the stairs at the end of the lab entrance path. Then a portal will open, and a bunch of Risen will pop out. You have to fight the Risen. They appear in the area in front of Larra's console. If you want to be right in the middle of a bunch of Risen, stand there. Otherwise, don't stand there.\nThen Larra will say some jibber jabber about what went wrong, and try again. This will cause another group of Risen to appear in the same place, this time including Risen Grubs. The lab's golems will fight the zombies, so if the fight is too tough, running around in circles while the golems beat up the\nRisen should work. Oh and don't worry about Larra, she will be completely safe inside a shield bubble for the whole fights.\nNext you have to leave the lab and go to the marked location southwest of the lab to find the dimensional anchor. Carys will go with you, bringing her big hammer. Once you get outside the lab and turn left, you will notice Risen on the path. Beat them up. Unfortunately, Carys won't help you fight these Risen. When you get to where the Risen were, there is a dead golem. This is where you turn left and go up the stairs. You may as well revive the golem, because at the top of the stairs, there are more Risen. If you run back down the stairs, some Risen will probably follow you, and the golem will help you fight them. There are also more golems at the area on top of the stairs, who will fight the Risen.\nHead up another set of stairs, to fight an Abomination who is fighting somebody in a Hazmat Suit. Talk to the Hazmat Suit to ask to borrow a dimensional anchor. Hazmat Suit will give you the anchor. Then you must return to Larra's lab.\nWhen you start down the stairs, you will notice that the area at the bottom of the stairs is full of Risen again. You could either fight them with the anchor, drop the anchor and fight them normally, (remembering to pick up the anchor after), or run past them without fighting. The path outside is also full of Risen again, so you can either fight them or run past.\nLarra's lab is also full of Risen, and you will have to fight them before you can place the dimensional anchor on the mirror. You could either fight them with the anchor, or drop it, and use your normal weapons. After the fight, revive any dead golems.\nGo to the glowing green blob while holding the anchor and press \"F\" to \"Anchor\" it. Then Larra will turn on her portal machine again, and yet another wave of Risen will pop out of the portal and attack. The golems will help you in the fight, but Larra and Carys won't. After the fight, Tegwen pops out of the mirror and talks about how scary it was in there.\nReturn to the Pale Tree and talk to Trahearne.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\n\n\n==== Venlin Vale ====\nAsura\nLarra\nGolems\nBAT 9929\nHazmat Suit\nPM-632n\nPM-632z\nSylvari\nCarys\nTegwen\n\n\n==== The Omphalos Chamber ====\nSylvari\nAvatar of the Tree\nCaithe\nTrahearne\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nRisen\nRisen Abomination\nRisen Brute\nRisen Grub\nRisen Plague Carrier\nRisen Thrall\nRisen Spider\n\n\n== Objects ==\nDimensional Anchor\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\n\n=== Venlin Vale ===\nSpeaking with Carys:\n\nCarys: We must save Tegwen. Even if it takes working with a cranky, musty, fussbudget of an asura.\n Don't worry. We'll save her.\nSpeaking with Larra (cinematic):\n\nLarra: Finally! What took you so long? Were you busy getting your hair pruned or something?\nLarra: I've had some time to study the mirror, and I've got good news and bad news.\nLarra: The good news is that I'm sure we can open the portal again.\n<Character name>: And the bad news?\nLarra: Once it's open, I have absolutely no way to control what comes through. But don't worry.\nLarra: I didn't graduate from some Statics clown college. I've got a plan! You want something done right, go with Dynamics.\nCarys: I don't care about stabbics or die-on-niffics or anything else. Tegwen's in trouble! Bring her back, or I'll shove you through that mirror after her!\nLarra: Less talk, more think, houseplant. Here's what we're going to do. I'll use a multiflux cluster to tap the mirror's matrix.\nLarra: The cluster'll lock on Tegwen's location, and then I'll use bio-block transmats to yank her back through.\n<Character name>: Yank? Is this safe? Have you ever done anything like this before?\nLarra: Aw, don't be so paranoid! Tegwen'll come back in one piece. Maybe a mushy sort of piece, but definitely whole. Let's get started and see what happens.\nAfter the cutscene:\n\nLarra: Everybody ready? This'll be a breeze.\nLarra: Ready the multiflux cluster!\nLarra: Targeting the mirror. Here we go!\nLarra: Engage the aural magnetics! Let's bend the laws of physics!\nCarys: The portal's open, and it's spewing undead! We have to keep them contained!\nSpeaking with Larra before defeating the undead:\n\nLarra: Give me space! I need my full concentration for this experiment.\n Experiment? You said you've done this before. Larra? Larra!\nAfter the first wave of undead is defeated:\n\nLarra: The problem there was in the power flow, not the wavelength.\nLarra: Okay, the calibrators are all on nominal. We should be good.\nLarra: Just to be sure, I'm overclocking the multiflux. Cover your ears. The fabric of reality might scream a little.\nLarra: Engage the aural magnetics! It's showtime!\nAfter defeating the second wave of undead:\n\nCarys: I've never seen so many undead, not even on the beach at Annwen!\nLarra: This is a slightly...larger result than I expected.\nLarra: We need to anchor the mirror here, so it remains stable. Otherwise it'll suck us all into Orr.\nLarra: Get a dimensional anchor from the Aethervolt gate scientists, weed, and get it fast!\nOn the way to the Aethervolt gate scientists:\n\nCarys: Undead! Just like on the beach. This I can handle!\nHeading up the steps:\n\nHazmat Suit: Look at all the undead. Someone do something about it!\nHazmat Suit: I'll hold the ground here. Hurry up, so I can get back to work!\nTalking to the Hazmat Suit wearing asura:\n\nThere I was, testing dimensional inconsistencies in my hazmat suit when that nonsense kicked up! Gadd's ears, can't Larra keep a stable environment?\n Excuse me. May I borrow your dimensional anchor for Larra?\nNow look here, <Character name>. This is complex magic. My dimensional anchor is tuned to a specific aetheric frequency. It's not a bathtub toy!\n That anchor can save my friend. I'm taking it, one way or another.\nAgh...my ears are wilting! Fine, fine, you can have it. I hope it shunts your steam!\n An actual anchor? I expected something more...weird.\nI'll take that as a compliment, thank-you-very-much.\n You do that. Thanks.\n I need it to stabilize an Orrian artifact. Lend it to me and I'll credit you with the results.\nCredit? Ah, you speak right into my heart. I can't say no to that! Here's the dimensional anchor.\n An actual anchor? I expected something more...weird. (same as above)\n Larra was right. Your anchor simply isn't ready for a serious test...\nLarra said that, did she? Well, I'll show her! Here, take it. Prove that my work's incomparable!\n An actual anchor? I expected something more...weird. (same as above)\n Sorry to bother you.\nAfter placing the anchor\n\nLarra: Maybe the overclocking wasn't such a great idea.\nLarra: Aha! There's the problem.\nLarra: I didn't set the bio-block filter for houseplant. I mean, sylvari. Uh, yeah.\nLarra: Okay, now she's humming. We'll get Tegwen. Or something. Here we go!\nCarys: She's got to be in there! Even if we have to pull every last bit of Orr thorugh, I'm not giving up!\nCinematic after the battle:\n\nCarys: Tegwen, are you all right? Did the dragon hurt you? I'm so glad it didn't eat you! Is anything missing? You do have all your pieces?\nTegwen: Zhaitan didn't eat me, but that crazy magical whatchamajig almost ripped me in half! What was that?\nLarra: That vast sucking noise was the delightful sound of you owing me your life.\nLarra: I am a genius! I will now accept your thanks and deafening applause.\n<Character name>: Thank you, Larra. Tegwen's safe, and we know better than to use the mirror again.\nTegwen: Safe...in a manner of speaking. That cursed land will haunt me the rest of my days. It held so much dispair.\n<Character name>: Try not to think about it. Stay near the Pale Tree for a while, and rest in the Grove. In time, your spirit will heal again.\nTegwen: Thank you, Valiant. Good luck.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nTegwen: I...I need a moment. Orr was farther gone than I ever imagined.\nCarys: You're safe now. You never have to go back to that horrible place.\nTegwen: I'm in charge of training you, and yet you've saved me twice. I feel like I've been letting you down.\nCarys: You've never let me down, Tegwen. What you taught me saved us both. I'll stay with you until you are strong again.\nSpeaking with your reunited allies:\n\nCarys: Those undead were far worse than the ones on our beach! I'm so glad you were here, <Character name>.\n I'm glad I could help, too.\nTegwen: Thank you. The horrors of that place are seared into my mind, but it has given me a new perspective. I must rest and consider my purpose.\n Be at ease, Tegwen.\nLarra: Some doubted me. Some ridiculed me. My mother told me to take up baking instead of dimensional naviphysics. Now...behold my genius!\n Your plan worked and the experiment succeeded. What will you study next?\nWorking with you frond-faces has been fun. I may take up horticulture. Perhaps we'll meet again someday.\n Under better circumstances, I hope. Take care.\n Ah...yes...you are very, very intelligent.\n\n\n=== The Grove ===\nApproaching your allies (cinematic):\n\n<Character name>: Firstborn Trahearne, I have the artifact that Tegwen saw on the beach. It's a mirror that can open a portal to Orr.\n<Character name>: Tegwen was pulled through, but Carys and I brought her home again—with a little help from an asura.\n<Character name>: Orr is a horrible place. Is it truly my Wyld Hunt to fight Zhaitan? I don't know that I'll ever be strong enough.\nTrahearne: Few have the courage to look into the heart of Orr. You've already proven yourself braver than most.\nAvatar of the Tree: The dragon's corruption is a blight that sickens the heart. If we do not stop Zhaitan, the entire world will wither and die.\n<Character name>: I understand what you mean now, Mother. We cannot allow the dragons to exist, even if it costs us our lives.\nAvatar of the Tree: Know that you will not face these dangers alone, my children. For now, be proud of the things you have accomplished.\nAvatar of the Tree: Valiant, I am proud of you. Though you have seen horrors, you now understand our greatest weapon against them. Hope.\n<Character name>: Thank you, Mother Tree. I will think on this. When you need me again, I will be ready.\nSpeaking with your allies after the cinematic:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: My beloved child, <Character name>. You have done well. I am so proud of you.\n You don't mind that I let the asura help?\nIf we are to save this world from the dragons, then all races must learn to work together. It is a brave thing you did, and I am pleased.\n May I ask another question?\n I'm very glad, Mother Tree.\n Can you tell me more about Orr and the mirror?\nIt's a foul place, and the mirror is a dangerous artifact...but still, we may need it someday.\n What will happen to the mirror now?\nIt'll be kept safely away until the time comes when, perhaps, we'll find a way to use it against Zhaitan.\n That is good to hear. Thank you, Mother Tree.\n What will happen to the mirror now?\n Thank you, Mother. I am grateful.\nCaithe: It's good to hear that Tegwen is back, no matter how it was done. I don't trust the asura, but in this case, your gamble paid off.\n Larra was a great help, actually, despite the fact that she was annoying.\nTrahearne: The horrors of Orr, so close to the Grove... I shudder to think what might've happened without you there.\n You think that was Zhaitan's plan all along?\nThe Elder Dragons are too chaotic to \"plan.\" More likely, this was done by one of its champions, who retained basic sentience.\n Horrifying. Orr is truly terrible.\n I'm very glad to have Tegwen back safely.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Meet up with the Knight of Embers, who calls her Courtiers nincompoops and sends your party to beat up the wardens without explaining where to find them.\nGo to the east side of the camp, near a giant leaf. From this point on, all the Courtiers turn hostile, and will attack on sight.\nThe wardens are inside a big red tree. Kill the Courtiers outside the tree before entering. Enter the tree, and kill the swarm of Courtiers who immediately attack. When the Courtiers have been defeated, the wardens run out to meet the party.\nLead the wardens out of the camp, down the hill generally toward the northwest. Kill the groups of Courtiers who attack along the way. The wardens and Malyck, with his pistols, will assist in the battles, but neither fights very effectively.\nAt the bottom of the hill, go through the gate to the green marker.

You don't know the difference?\nMalyck: No. I've never heard of either one.\n<Character name>: You remember the Pale Tree, yes?\nMalyck: No. Look, we need to get the Wardens back to Falias Thorp. Here's the plan: we infiltrate and sneak the villagers out. Then...revenge.\n<Character name>: You're strange, Malyck, but I like your style. Let's go.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nMalyck: Hm. We could steal their armor and wear it as a disguise...once they don't need it anymore.\nTalking to Malyck before stealing clothes:\n\nMalyck: We need to steal clothing for the disguises.\n Good idea. I'll keep my eyes peeled.\nTalking to Malyck after stealing clothes:\n\nMalyck: The Nightmare Court makes my skin crawl. Where do these monsters come from? Are you at war?\n You don't know about the court?\nI hadn't heard of them before they attacked. What is their purpose?\n The Nightmare Court wants to plunge the entire sylvari race into evil. They want to corrupt our Dream.\nSounds like nonsense—but I'll trust you. Certainly, the fact that they're evil can't be denied.\n I'll explain it when we're safer. Let's hurry up and get out of here.\n It's difficult to war on one's own people.\nYour own people? You mean, you're related to them? Ugh. I don't envy you that familiarity.\n We don't enjoy it— and we do everything we can to stop them from gaining power.\n There's no time to answer questions. Let's find those prisoners—we'll talk later.\nApproaching the nightmare camp:\n\nNightmare Court Page: How about those new converts? How long do you give them?\nNightmare Court Squire: Not long. I heard the Knight of Embers came for them, and she was in a mood.\nTalking to Nightmare Courtiers:\n\nNightmare Court Page: Hmmph. You two look fresh off the vine.\n I'm very new. Tell me, who is the Knight of Embers?\nYou really are new! The Knight of Embers is our liege. She's powerful, clever, and deadly. Remember that.\n Thanks for the heads-up.\n Excuse me, I have to be going.\nNightmare Court Squire: Get away from me, peon.\n Tell me about the Knight of Embers, or I'll tear that wagging tongue out of your mouth!\nNo, please! Don't hurt me! The Knight of Embers is our leader. She's tremendously powerful.\n Is that all you know? Bah.\n Shut up, you ignorant weed.\nNightmare Court Knight: Come on, leave me be. Does it look like I'm going to be any more trouble today?\n Tell me what I want, and I'll leave you alone. Who is the Knight of Embers?\nFine. The Knight of Embers is looking for someone. We tried to find him—but we failed.\n That's all I needed to know. Thanks.\n Be silent.\nFurther into the camp:\n\nNightmare Court Page: These Wardens are delicate little puffballs.\nNightmare Court Bowman: (laugh) The Knight of Embers knocked him flat!\nNightmare Court Knight: They'll tell us about the Harbinger soon enough. You'll see.\nEncountering the Knight of Embers:\n\nMalyck: That's the Knight of Embers, isn't it?\nKnight of Embers: You're all useless and weak. I should burn your flesh from your bones.\nCinematic with the Knight of Embers:\n\nKnight of Embers: I sent those fools to bring me the harbinger, and instead they come back with whimpering wardens! Pathetic!\nKnight of Embers: You there! You're new. Can you follow orders, courtier?\n<Character name>: Uhm...me? Er...yes, ma'am? My lady?\nKnight of Embers: Then you're in charge. Make these wretched wardens talk. Do whatever it takes. Hit them so hard the Pale Tree can feel it.\nKnight of Embers: They will tell me where to find the harbinger, or they will die feeding nightmare with their agony.\n<Character name>: My lady knight? May I ask? What is a harbinger?\nKnight of Embers: He is the Pale Tree's doom, and nightmare's vindication. He is my Dark Hunt. When I find him, all will be made clear. Now, go!\nWhile going to the captives:\n\nMalyck: Yes, lead the way, courtier.\nNightmare Court Bowman: Bah! Get out of our way. We started this task—we'll finish it!\nWhen approaching the captives:\n\nMalyck: That must be where they're hiding the Wardens.\nCaptive Warden: Ready yourself, they're coming back. This may be our only chance to escape...\nCaptive Warden: Wait! Captain Banya, do you see what I see?\nCaptain Banya: By the Pale Tree's wisdom—Malyck! What are you doing here?\nMalyck: Time to cut and run!\nNightmare Courtier: Don't let them get away!\nCaptain Banya: Wait, don't waste time answering. Just get us out!\nMalyck: Get the Wardens out of here!\nTalking to Malyck before freeing the captives:\n\nMalyck: Let's get these sylvari out of here and to safety.\n Right away.\nTalking to Malyck after freeing the captives:\n\nMalyck: I want to punish these courtiers, but the safety of my friends come[sic] first. I'll get them away from here.\n You're very loyal. Have you known them long?\nNo. They rescued me in the forest, and I've been trying to repay their kindness.\n That's very honorable of you, Malyck.\n Very well.\nTalking to Captain Banya:\n\nCaptain Banya: We must flee this accursed place! Leave the cavern and get back to the road.\n We'll get you to safety. You have my word.\nWhile escaping:\n\nCaptain Banya: Help the injured. Stay close to each other. Take any weapons you find. Malyck, Valiant—thank you.\nCaptive Warden: Stay together! Move quickly!\nCaptive Warden: Hurry! Let's get out of here!\nVeteran Nightmare Courtier: Suffer and die!\nCaptive Warden: This way! Before the courtiers return.\nCaptain Banya: We've gone far enough. We can stop.\nCinematic with Malyck:\n\nMalyck: I owed these Wardens my life. You, Valiant—you risked yourself to save my friends, even though you've never met them. Why?\n<Character name>: Because we are all sylvari. We all follow the Dream. Can't you feel that we are related?\nMalyck: Feel it? No. I feel nothing, Valiant. Only a great sense of distance, and loss.\n<Character name>: You've been too long from the Pale Tree, that's all. When you return, she will heal your lost memory. Come back with me to the Grove. You'll see.\nMalyck: I hope you are right. I want to hear more about this \"Dream.\" If your friends can help me, then I will meet with them.\n<Character name>: Make your way south to the great tree near the shore. I will meet you there. We'll get to the bottom of this mystery, I promise.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nCaptain Banya: I owe you so much! A million thanks.\nTalking to Captain Banya:\n\nCaptain Banya: I am tremendously grateful for the rescue. We Wardens owe a great debt, both to you and to Malyck.\n What will the Wardens do now?\nMy Wardens will return to the Pale Tree and recover before resuming duty at Falias Thorp.\n Good idea. May I ask another question?\n I wish you a swift recovery, Captain.\n Will you be returning to Falias Thorp?\nI don't know. It would be foolish to leap back into active duty while I'm still nursing these wounds. Still...\n Stay in my garden in the Grove. The menders there will heal you.\nThat is most gracious, Valiant. I shall consider it. Either way, I hope to see you again.\n Good luck, Captain Banya.\n I wish you a swift recovery, Captain.\n Malyck was determined to free you. Have you known him long?\nWe found him injured in the forest, a few weeks back. Still, he's been a stalwart ally, and he's become a friend.\n He seems quite loyal. May I ask another question?\n I wish you a swift recovery, Captain.\n You are most welcome, Captain.\nTalking to Malyck:\n\nMalyck: You upheld your part of the bargain. I'll go see your friends, as promised, but no guarantees.\n They are the ones who wanted to meet you, so I'm sure you'll be fine.\nI hope so. Otherwise, this will be a very short meeting.\n Take care, Malyck.\n Don't worry. No need to win their friendship. They only want to meet you.\nNoted. I'll just be myself.\n That's all anyone expects.\n Thank you, Malyck. I'll see you at the Grove.\n\n\n=== The Grove ===\nApproaching Caithe and Trahearne:\n\nMalyck: I trust you, Valiant. These others, well, we shall have to see.\nTrahearne: The Nightmare Court is searching everywhere for this \"harbinger\".\nCaithe: They won't stop until they find it.\nTrahearne: Whatever is is, we must find it first.\nTalking to your allies:\n\nMalyck: I'm not sure about this, <Character name>. I trust you, but not your friends.\n They just want to help you, Malyck.\nTrahearne: Greetings to you—and your mysterious friend.\n Trahearne, meet Malyck.\nCinematic introducing Malyck:\n\n<Character name>: Caithe, Trahearne. I have a very strange story to tell you.\n<Character name>: This is Malyck. The Nightmare Court believe he is the harbinger—of what, we don't know. But they attacked those Warden camps to find him.\nCaithe: Malyck is your name? You feel...oddly quiet. Strangely still.\nTrahearne: When did you awaken at the Pale Tree? In what cycle? What did you Dream?\nMalyck: Tree? I know no Pale Tree. I have had no Dream. My first memory begins two weeks ago. I was lying by a river, staring up at an arched bridge.\nMalyck: I was injured, and I wandered the forest from there, following the river until the Wardens found me and took me in.\nTrahearne: No Dream? Perhaps you have only forgotten it. If you were badly injured, your memories could be damaged or lost. Perhaps if we look into the Dream itself, we could find them.\nCaithe: Or we could follow the river and locate the place Malyck describes. Maybe we'll meet someone who knows him and memory will return on its own.\nMalyck: I must know who I am, to fight the Nightmare Court. Valiant, I trust you. Which do you think is the best method to find the truth.\nTalking to Malyck before choosing a plan:\n\nMalyck: Both ideas seem worthwhile. I'll let you decide.\n All right.\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: Caithe and I wish only to aid Malyck. You must decide which plan is best.\n Can you give me more details about your plan?\nSeer Amaranda is deeply connected to the Dream. If any sylvari has information about Malyck...she will find it.\n Sounds very interesting. I'd like to meet her. I choose your plan. (see \"I like your plan...\")\n I need a few minutes to make a decision.\n I like your plan, Trahearne. Let's seek out the Seer.\nNothing is certain, Valiant. Remember, if you choose to go with me, you cannot change your mind.\n I'm sure about this. Let's go talk to Amaranda.\n Hm. Let me speak to Caithe one more time.\n I need to think about this just a little longer.\nTalking to Caithe:\n\nCaithe: Very well, <Character name>. Have you made a decision?\n Would you explain your plan again?\nCertainly. We start where Malyck was found and backtrack from there. Hopefully, it reveals his origins.\n How certain are you that we'll find something?\nNothing is certain, Valiant. Remember, if you choose to go with me, you cannot change your mind.\n Understood. Still, your plan is the more likely to find the truth.\n Let me speak to Trahearne before I make up my mind.\n I need more time to think about this.\n Your idea sounds best, Caithe. We should search for evidence. (see \"How certain...\")\n Let me consider this decision.\nDialogue if choosing to look into the Dream:\n\nCaithe: While the three of you speak with the seer, I will search for the site of Malyck's first memory.\nTrahearne: Agreed. We should investigate every avenue of discovery.\nCaithe: I will meet you back at the Pale Tree. Farewell.\nTalking to your allies after choosing Trahearne's plan:\n\nTrahearne: I'll admit, I'm curious to see where the seer's visions lead us.\n Who is Amaranda and how do you know her?\nShe's a secondborn, awakened from the Pale Tree just after the firstborn. Her connection to the Dream is incredible.\n I look forward to meeting her.\n As am I. See you there.\nCaithe: Hm. I prefer solid evidence to oracular visions, but...I will trust your instincts.\n Thanks, Caithe.\nDialogue if choosing to search for the pod:\n\nTrahearne: While the three of you search the site of Malyck's first memory, I will speak with my friend, the seer.\nCaithe: Agreed. We should learn all that we can.\nTrahearne: I will meet you back at the Pale Tree. Be safe, my sister.\nTalking to your allies after choosing Caithe's plan:\n\nCaithe: Excellent. We have no time to waste. Are you prepared?\n I am. Where do I meet you?\nVenlin Vale. Our search begins there. Good journey, Valiant.\n I'll see you there.\n I'm ready. Let's get going.\nTrahearne: Caithe is wise, in her way. Not particularly trusting—but her plan is sound.\n I think so. Farewell, Trahearne.\nTalking to Malyck after a plan is chosen:\n\nMalyck: We're committed to this plan. I'll hope for the best.\n Me too.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

Also there are Nightmare Courtiers in town. Kill them. Then revive the wardens. Near one of the houses is a pumpkin looking thing called a water bucket. Get it, and put out the fires by running into a fire and pouring water. Once the fires are out, you will get attacked by multiple waves of Nightmare Courtiers.

It is good to see you once more within the Grove.\nTrahearne: It is hard for me to return. Each time I do, I feel more and more distant.\nCaithe: Let the Mother shelter you. It will pass.\nCaithe: There you are, Valiant, Come. Meet Trahearne.\nCinematic:\n\nCaithe: Greetings, Valiant. I want you to meet Trahearne, another of the sylvari firstborn.\nCaithe: Only a few firstborn are called to Wyld Hunts. I have the calling. So does Trahearne. I believe he carries the heaviest burden of us all.\n<Character name>: More difficult than fighting an Elder Dragon?\nCaithe: Our task is tangible, if dangerous. His is ephemeral. There may be no solution.\nTrahearne: I'm glad to meet you, but I'm afraid we have no time for proper welcomes. There is a more immediate matter at hand.\nCaithe: Just before you arrived, a messenger brought news of three attacks by the Nightmare Court. I can aid one, Trahearne another...\n<Character name>: I'll take the third. Where do you need me to go?\nCaithe: They're besieging the Warden outpost of Falias Thorp. Make your way there as quickly as possible, Valiant, and lend a hand.\nTrahearne: Before you go, a warning. On my way to the Grove, I heard a rumor that the Nightmare Court are seeking something called the \"harbinger.\"\nTrahearne: They are determined to find it, whatever it may be—and based on that alone, we must stop them.\n<Character name>: Understood. I'll head to Falias Thorp right away.\nTalking to your allies:\n\nCaithe: I apologize for hte urgency of this task, Valiant, but the situation offers few options.\n May I ask a question?\nYes, but bear in mind that we have little time.\n What is the \"harbinger\"?\nI don't know, but the Nightmare Court is obsessed with it. We need to find it before they do.\n I have one more question.\n Very well. I'll Figure it out as I go.\n Can you tell me about Falias Thorp?\nA warden outpost, south of a major Nightmare Court holding. They may be under heavy assault.\n One more quick question, if you please?\n I'm on it. See ya.\n What can you tell me about these attacks?\nQuick assaults, burned villages, general chaos. This isn't random damage...the Nightmare Court is looking for something.\n May I ask something else?\n Sounds bad. I'm on my way.\n I'll head to Falias Thorp right away. Thanks.\n Thanks for the information, Caithe.\nTrahearne: I am glad to meet you, Valiant. Caithe has had few friends since...I think you will be good for her.\n May I ask a question?\nOf course. How may I aid you?\n Can you tell me more about your Wyld Hunt?\nI am challenged to cleanse the land of Orr. In my dream, I saw it green and growing again.\n May I ask another question?\n That would be amazing. Is it even possible?\nWe don't know yet. I've seen nothing to show that...well, I must not lose hope.\n May I ask another question?\n Thank you for the information.\n That sounds difficult. We'll speak again, in the future.\n What is the \"harbinger\" that the Nightmare Court seeks?\nCaptive members of the court know little, other than that they must find it—and soon. Whatever it is, we must stop them.\n Is it that bad?\nThe Nightmare Court is single-minded, but this...this is only blind fanaticism. We must know more.\n May I ask another question?\n Let's nip this in the bud, then!\n May I ask another question?\n I understand. Thank you.\n How well do you know Caithe?\nWe are both firstborn, tasked to face the challenges of Orr. She is a sister to me, in spirit and in purpose.\n May I ask another question?\n That's good to know\n I'll be headed out now. See you soon.\n I'm glad to help. Good luck out there.\n\n\n=== Wychmire Swamp ===\nApproaching Malyck (cinematic):\n\nMalyck: Who are you? Are you another of these murderers?\n<Character name>: Calm down, I'm a friend. Who are you, and what's going on?\nMalyck: My name is Malyck. The Wardens took me in. They found me, injured, in the forest. I was here when the outpost was attacked.\nMalyck: The Wardens said these creatures are called the \"Nightmare Court.\" They've set fire to the camp, and cut down everything in their path.\nMalyck: We're outnumbered, besieged, and most of the guard has been injured. I'm all that's left of the defense.\n<Character name>: Let me fight with you, Malyck. I know the Nightmare Court, and I'd be glad to raise arms against them.\nMalyck: I'll have to trust you—I've no other choice. But I warn you, the Wardens are under my protection, and I will let no harm fall on them.\nMalyck: Help me drive back these villains, quickly. We must put out the fires before they spread to the forest.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nMalyck: The time for chatter is over. Now, we fight.\nTalking to Malyck:\n\nMalyck: These fiends must pay for the horror they have wrought upon my friends!\n What should I do about the fires?\nBuckets of water would work best, I think.\n How do I help the wardens? (Same as below)\n How many courtiers are out there? (Same as \"How many Nightmare Court members are out there?\")\n I'm on it!\n How do I help the wardens?\nBandage their wounds, and they might be able to help us defend this place!\n What should I do about the fires? (Same as above)\n How many courtiers are out there? (Same as \"How many Nightmare Court members are out there?\")\n I'm on it!\n How many Nightmare Court members are out there?\nMany. I predict they'll attack in waves—keep your wits about you.\n What should I do about the fires? (Same as above)\n How do I help the wardens? (Same as above)\n On it!\n On it!\nApproaching the outpost:\n\nMalyck: Those who cannot give mercy, deserve none.\nAfter reviving the last warden:\n\nMalyck: That's all we're saving.\nTalking to the wardens before the fighting's over:\n\nWarden: Well done! Let's destroy these monsters!\n We shall!\nWarden Ranger: Those scoundrels won't get away with this!\n Not this time.\nWarden Shield: Rally, wardens! We shall defeat our foes!\n For the Pale Tree!\nPutting out the last of the fires:\n\nMalyck: With the fires out, the outpost should be able to recover.\nAfter various waves of Nightmare Courtiers:\n\nNightmare Courtier: Cut them open!\nNightmare Courtier: Your simple mind will know terror.\nTalking to Malyck when Veteran Nightmare Courtier appears:\n\nMalyck: Is this the courtier responsible for the attack? We shall end him!\n Agreed!\nWhile fighting Veteran Nightmare Courtier:\n\nVeteran Nightmare Courtier: You'll die by my hand! (upon aggro)\nVeteran Nightmare Courtier: Hunt them down! (75% health)\nVeteran Nightmare Courtier: You can die now! (50% health)\nVeteran Nightmare Courtier: No! Impossible. I'm not a failure! (25% health)\nAfter the fighting is over, before talking to Malyck:\n\nWarden: Pale Tree preserve us...that was close!\n We made it!\nWarden Ranger: Thank the Mother Tree you came along.\n I'm just glad everyone's all right.\nWarden Shield: My stars! That was intense.\n I'm just glad everyone's all right.\nTalking to Malyck after the fight (cinematic):\n\nMalyck: You fight well, stranger. I'm grateful you came along. I hope you'll forgive my initial mistrust.\n<Character name>: It was in the heat of battle. It's understandable. Tell me, do you know why the Nightmare Court were here? It's not like them to attack the Wardens head-on.\nMalyck: I do. It seems that they wanted me. I don't know why. I've never met their kind before and I'm certainly no friend to them.\nMalyck: They kept calling me the \"Harbinger.\" When I resisted, the courtiers took hostages. They threatened to harm them if I didn't give myself up.\nMalyck: I was willing, but Captain Banya refused to allow it. \"I'm a civilian,\" she said, \"and they were Wardens.\" I told her she was a fool, and now...she's gone, too.\n<Character name>: Whatever the Nightmare Court is planning for you, I can assure you—it isn't pleasant. Come back to the Grove with me, where you'll be safe.\nMalyck: The Grove? is that where your people come from?\n<Character name>: My people? You mean the sylvari? Malyck...don't you know about the Grove?\nMalyck: No. I do not come from these lands. I apprieciate[sic] your offer, but I won't abandon the Wardens.\nMalyck: I'll go with you after they're safe, and the Nightmare Court's been punished. The courtiers said they were going to Joy's End.\n<Character name>: Joy's End? Sounds lovely. I'll meet you there.\nTalking to your allies after the cinematic:\n\nMalyck: Sorry if I was harsh earlier. All I could think about was protecting my friends.\n I understand. We've fought together now—please, call me <Character name>.\n<Character name>. Thank you, both for fighting here, and for agreeing to help me. We must rescue those wardens.\n Agreed. First, can I ask a few questions?\nCertainly. What can I help you with?\n Tell me about Warden Banya.\nShe was very kind to me. She gave me these weapons...and taught me to use them.\n We'll find her. Let me ask you something else?\n She sounds like a good person. We'll find her. I promise.\n Do you know anything else about the \"harbinger\"?\nNothing. I've never heard the term before.\n Don't worry about it. Can I ask you something else?\n I wonder what they're looking for? Thanks, though.\n You've really never been to the Grove?\nNo—or, if I have, I cannot recall it. Right now, there are other, more important things to worry about.\n Right. Let me ask you something else?\n I understand. We'll talk more later.\n Thank you for all your answers. Let's get going.\n Absolutely. See you soon.\n I understand. We'll get them back.\nWarden: You saved our lives. Thank you!\n What did those courtiers want?\nThey were after our friend Malyck, I think. Maybe because he's a young sylvari, and they think they can corrupt him?\n Hm. Well, that's one theory.\n No problem. Take care!\nWarden Ranger: Thank you for your aid, friend. It was good to see you in our hour of need.\n Tell me, Warden—how long has Malyck lived among you?\nNot long at all. We found him injured in the forest, perhaps a few weeks ago.\n Interesting. Thank you.\n Take care of yourself, Warden.\nWarden Shield: You're a brave one, friend. I admire that! You're as brave as any of our wardens.\n Can you tell me more about this outpost?\nWe've had our share of conflict—hostile hylek, monsters in the swamps—but nothing like this. Those courtiers were fanatics.\n Unsettling. I wish you the best of luck here.\n That's a kind compliment. Thank you.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nEnemies originally included Nightmare Court Knight, Nightmare Court Squire, Nightmare Court Page, Nightmare Apprentice, Nightmare Court Kennelmaster, Nightmare Court Bowman, Dark Count, and Veteran Nightmare Apprentice.",

Tell me where they're making the trade, and I'll see that everything goes well.\nTrahearne: Thank you. The twins are very young, and they can be argumentative, but they have good hearts.\nTrahearne: They will be meeting the Hazupl caravan just north of Mabon Market to make the trade.\nTalking to Caithe:\n\nCaithe: Thank you for taking this on. The hylek are difficult, but this is a large step toward peace.\n Can you tell me more about Arlon and Pellam?\nThey're eager. Perhaps too much so. It's difficult to keep them under control.\n We should encourage eagerness. It means they're brave.\n Perhaps experience will serve them better than control. They will learn in time.\n I can calm even the most wayward tempers with a few words. Leave it to me.\nYour enthusiasm is refreshing. Take care, sapling. I shall trust in you.\n I won't let you down. Farewell!\n Trahearne said that twins were rare for sylvari?\nIndeed. Only a few every season. They often share a Dream and know each other well before they awaken.\n Very fascinating.\n I won't let you down. Farewell!\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: Thank you, <Character name>. I appreciate your help. If there's anything you need to know, you have but to ask.\n What else do you know about Arlon and Pellam?\nThey've been out of the pod for several years, but they're as wild as fresh saplings, constantly at odds with each other.\n How so?\nPellam is a spellcaster; Arlon is the opposite. They disagree over whose method is better.\n I understand. Can I ask you something else?\n I see. I'll do my best.\n I'll make sure it goes smoothly.\n Can you tell me more about the zalisco extract?\nOnly hylek can harvest and process the zalisco plant. It's toxic to everyone else.\n Don't worry. I'll take care of it.\n What can you tell me about the hylek?\nSome tribes are friendly, others hostile. The Hazupl tribe are friendly to us, but they remain wary.\n I had another question for you.\n I'll make sure it goes smoothly.\n I'm curious. What is your Wyld Hunt?\nI dreamed of cleansing the dragon's corruption from the land of Orr. In my dream, I saw it green and growing again.\n Wow. That'll be difficult. I see why you're interested in zalisco extract.\nExactly. Anything that could help drive back the corruption... Well, you understand.\n I do. Thank you for telling me. May I ask something else?\n I'll make sure it goes smoothly.\n I'll make sure it goes smoothly. Farewell.\n\n\n=== In The Rootangle ===\nTalking to Researcher Zippti:\n\nResearcher Zippti: I'll leave if Trahearne asks nicely, but putting my lab in the care of nitwit seedpods...grrr! If those ninnies touch anything, I'll fry their fronds!\n I'm sure everything will be fine in your absence. Thank you for your cooperation.\nCinematic with Arlon and Pellam:\n\n<Character name>: Hello. Are you Arlon and Pellam?\nArlon: That's us! Slayers of wyrms, jungle plants, and undead of all kinds, at your service. How can we help you?\n<Character name>: Actually, I'm here to help you. The firstborn asked me to go with you to meet the hylek.\nArlon: What? They don't trust us to do the job? Ah, well, the more the merrier. You're welcome to come.\nPellam: You're just in time. The Hazupl tribe should be here any minute. We're supposed to meet them, play nice, and trade these supplies for the zalisco extract.\nPellam: Oh, this should be fun. Hylek are fascinating. Don't worry about the formalities - I'll do the talking. I enjoy meeting new friends.\nArlon: Pellam's great at that. Me, I'm more the thumpy-fist-face sort of guy. It's amazing that we're twins - we're really nothing alike!\nArlon: I think I hear the hylek coming through the forest. Everyone get ready to say hello!\nWhile hylek approach:\n\nArlon: One time, I killed three undead creepers with a single swing.\nPellam: That's because I was distracting the other five by juggling stones.\nArlon: Oh yeah? Well, I...oh, look! The hylek are here!\nTalking to Arlon and Pellam as the hylek approach:\n\nArlon: I've never met a hylek, but apparently they have a thing about twins. Isn't that odd?\n It's a unique quirk of their culture. Just smile and be nice.\nPellam: Hylek are big frog-people, right? You don't think we look too much like food to them?\n They eat bugs, not plants. We're as safe with them as with charr.\nCinematic when hylek arrive:\n\nSpeaker Mahuti: My name is Speaker Mahuti. Here, let me look on you both. Amazing. We did not know that your race could have twins!\nPellam: We can, Speaker. My brother and I awakened from the same pod. Our dream was shared.\nSpeaker Mahuti: The sun shines brightly upon you, indeed. I have brought the zalisco extract for your firstborn. Be careful. Until the sap is mixed into potions, it is extremely deadly.\nPellam: My brother and I will guard it well. It will stay in our care until we place it in Trahearne's own hands.\nHylek Amini: Vile, sunless wretch - Mahuti of the Hazupl! You dare trade hylek secrets with outsiders? The Dengatl tribe will not allow this. To protect the extract, we will take it from you by force!\nSpeaker Mahuti: May the sun god blister your skin, Dengatl thief. We will defend ourselves!\nArlon: How dare those Dengatl threaten our allies. Ready your weapons and charge! We can drive them off!\nPellam: No, don't attack! Feint! We can lead the other tribe astray, and escape in the confusion. Here, follow me!\n<Character name>: Wait, both of you! We have to guard the Hazupl. Don't run off - HEY!\nDuring fight with Dengatl:\n\nArlon: Get over here, you bloat-throated spy! I'll stab you good!\nSpeaker Mahuti: Wait! Sylvari! Do not leave us!\nSpeaker Mahuti: The Dengatl outnumber us!\nPellam: Thorns! It's a trap!\nArlon: Thorns! It's a trap!\nTochzotl: Grab the Hazupl goods! Attack!\nSpeaker Mahuti: Rise like the Sun! The Dengatl must not steal the extract!\nSpeaker Mahuti: Valiant! Aid us! There are too many of them!\nPellam: Brace yourselves! They're serious!\nArlon: To action! The hylek are everywhere!\nTalking to NPCs between waves:\n\nSpeaker Mahuti: By the immortal, everburning sun!\nArlon: Get them before they get us!\n Right!\nCinematic after fight:\n\nArlon: Briars! The Dengatl took the zalisco extract while we were fighting! This is your fault, Pellam.\nPellam: My fault? If you'd stayed behind while I led them away, the extract would have been safe.\nArlon: While you led them away? That was a dumb plan. I was running to attack them - you should have stayed behind!\nSpeaker Mahuti: The sun has turned its face from us! I never should have come here. I never should have agreed to give you the zalisco extract.\n<Character name>: I'm deeply sorry, Speaker Mahuti. We'll retrieve the extract before anything else goes wrong.\nSpeaker Mahuti: You sound like you believe that. Hrrm. I wish I did. The Dengatl will use that sap to create powerful poisons. I must return and tell my chief what has happened.\nPellam: I've seen hylek caravans at the Hanto Trading Post. Someone there might know where to find the Dengatl village.\nArlon: Good idea! Valiant, why don't you meet us there?\nTalking to NPCs:\n\nSpeaker Mahuti: You have great valor, <character name>. I will tell our tribe's warriors of your bravery. Is there something you wish to know?\n What does the title \"Speaker\" mean?\n\"Tlatotetl,\" in the ancient tongue. \"Speaker,\" in yours. \"One who is as flame.\" I draw my tribe together, and act as light so that they may see our direction.\n Your culture is fascinating. Can I ask a few more questions?\n Intriguing. I wish you a safe journey home, Speaker—I mean Tlatotetl.\n Tell me more about the Hazupl tribe? [sic]\nThe Hazupl are not the most powerful or the most numerous, but we are skilled alchemists. Even other tribes—like the Sun-cursed Dengatl—are jealous of our knowledge.\n Very interesting. Can I ask a few more questions?\n Good to know. Have a safe journey home, Speaker.\n Why would another hylek tribe want the zalisco extract?\nOnly the Hazupl know the secret of zalisco. Firstborn Trahearne came to us humbly, so we shared. The other tribes try to steal it, so we fight!\n Good for Trahearne. Can I ask a few more questions?\n All the more reason for us to retrieve it. Safe journeys, Speaker Mahuti.\n Thank you for your patience, Speaker Mahuti. Have a safe journey home.\nArlon: Brambles! I can't believe Pellam messed this up so badly. That was foolish.\n It wasn't the best idea, but at least Speaker Mahuti is safe—and you both fought bravely. (first time only)\nKind of you to say. Still...Trahearne won't be as forgiving.\n Don't worry. Meet me at the Trading Post, and we'll fix this.\n Bury the blame, Arlon. It's your fault as well as his. We're all responsible. (first time only)\nYou're right. But we can undo the harm we've done. We must! Trahearne is counting on us.\n Exactly! You two meet me at the Trading Post, and we'll fix this.\n Let's focus on getting the zalisco extract back. (first time only)\nYou sound like Trahearne...but you're right. We should concentrate on our duty.\n Exactly. I'll meet you both at the Trading Post.\n I don't have time to argue. I'm headed to the Trading Post. Meet you there.\nPellam: Poorly done—poorly done, Arlon! I'm glad you were here, <character name>, to save our sorry lives.\n Don't blame Arlon. You're just as much at fault.  (first time only)\nAll right, all right! Fine. We both acted badly. So now what do we do?\n To the Trading Post to clean up this mess! Meet you there.\n This debacle can still be rectified. Concentrate on recovering the zalisco. (first time only)\nTrue, true. Better to fix the situation than affix the blame.\n Exactly. Hard ground makes stronger roots!\n Come now, Pellam. Your brother just needs some wisdom. Surely you see that? (first time only)\nI suppose you're right...but try to get him to admit it! Had!\n To Trading Post. We need the zalisco back. I'll meet you there.\n As am I. Take care.\n\n\n== My story ==",

      "strWikiText": "Eye of the Sun is a part of the Sylvari personal story for characters who decided the most important teaching is \"All things have a right to grow\" and have finished Trading Trickery or the Direct Approach.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nReport to Trahearne.\n\nMeet Trahearne and the twins in the Grove.\nSpeak with Trahearne.\n\nStop Tochzotl from using the Eye of the Sun.\nRendezvous with the others near the Ogotl grounds.\nInvestigate the Ogotl grounds.\nUse the turret to destroy the toxic pots.\nContinue onto the Ogotl grounds.\nUse the turret to destroy the toxic pots shielding Tochzotl.\nChieftain Tochzotl: 100%\nMake sure the twins are okay.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\nClick here to edit the reward data\n\nAll professions\n2,808 \n  Spirit Shard\n  Thorny Seed Pouch (Basic)\n  Signet Ring of the Grove\nProfession-specific\n   Arborist Coat, Duty-Bound Duffers\n   Evergreen Coat, Ragamuffin Toeshoes\n   Snapdragon Coat, Homespun Espadrilles\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nGo to the mission start point in Brisban Wildlands. Talk to Trahearne. Depending on which mission preceded this, you will meet with either Arlon or Pellam. After a short cut scene, enter and swim upriver to the hylek grounds, staying below the surface in case of attack. It is advisable to have an up-to-date underwater weapon, as there will be at least eight hylek barring the way.\nYou will have to find and use a turret to destroy a poison wall blocking the river passage. This is the only method that will clear the poison effect and allow you to proceed on the mission. Do not swim into the green poisoned water, or you will die. Any hylek in the area of the turret should be killed first, otherwise they can disrupt your effort to use it.\nAfter reaching the grounds at the end of the canyon, go east of the point of interest; on the bank is another turret. Use this turret to destroy another poison wall. Aim the green crosshairs at the wiggling pots on the ground. There are more hyleks in the water in front of the turret, you should kill them first or they will attack you and give you trouble while you are trying to use the turret.\nOnce you have destroyed all the poison pots, the hylek chief Tochzotl will drink the potion and turn into a more powerful form. Defeat him, then speak to Arlon/Pellam to finish the mission. Unlike his minions, Tochzotl is not immune to poison, which make the turret more helpful when fighting him.\nOccasionally after defeating the final boss there is difficulty in ending the mission. Try wandering around a bit around the boss and towards the cells behind the boss spawn point and the final cutscene should trigger. If not, you may need to repeat the mission.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nHylek\nHylek Cuicani (dead)\nSylvari\nArlon\nCaithe\nPellam\nTrahearne\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nAmbient creatures\nLightning Bug\nOsprey\nHylek\nHylek Amini\nHylek Cuicani\nHylek Nahualli\nHylek Tlamatini\nTochzotl\n\n\n== Objects ==\nSiege weapons\nHylek Poison Turret\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\n\n=== Dreamer's Terrace ===\nUpon entering instance:\n\nTrahearne: Valiant, hurry to me. We have much to discuss.\nCaithe: I see only one twin. Where is the other?\nCinematic upon approaching Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: Good timing. Arlon/Pellam just finished telling me what happened at the Dengatl grounds.\nTrahearne: I've read about the \"Eye of the Sun\" in ancient hylek scrolls. It's a potion said to have the power to transform the imbiber into an avatar of the sun.\nTrahearne: It's extremely difficult to make and very unstable. I thought it was just a myth.\n<Character name>: Apparently not. Tochzotl, the Ogotl speaker, believes that he can create the potion and become the Eye of the Sun.\nTrahearne: Even if Tochzotl fails to become an avatar, the potion he's making will be extremely toxic. If it gets out of control, it could poison the entire Ogotl tribe.\nArlon: (if did The Direct Approach) We were able to recover some of the zalisco extract from the Dengatl—but it isn't much.\nPellam: (if did Trading Trickery) We were able to recover some of the zalisco extract from the Dengatl—but it isn't much.\nTrahearne: It'll have to be enough. I'll start working on a counter-agent. You two head for the Ogotl grounds. Caithe and I will meet you there.\nTrahearne: There's no time to waste. If Tochzotl makes that potion and drinks it, he'll become unbelievably powerful—and likely go insane.\nArlon: (if did The Direct Approach) Wait—where's Pellam? We'll need his cleverness to defeat Tochzotl.\nPellam: (if did Trading Trickery) Wait—where's Arlon? We'll need his strength to defeat Tochzotl.\nTrahearne: I'm sorry, Arlon/Pellam. He hasn't returned. I'll leave word here for him to meet us at the Ogotl grounds.\nTalking to the NPCs:\n\nArlon: We can't go without Pellam! He could be in danger.\n I'm sure Pellam would want us to act swiftly. We can't afford to wait.\nYou're right...but I don't like it. I feel lost. Why did I let him go alone?\n Don't berate yourself. Whatever's wrong, we'll fix it—after the Ogotl.\n Don't be cowardly. It's a fight you wanted—and it's a fight you're going to get.\nI...a fight? Yes. That is what I wanted, isn't it? But now...\n Then ready your weapon, and prepare to defend the Grove.\n It's too late for regrets. Shake it off. We need your strong arm.\nI'll be fine. I'm just worried about Pellam.\n When this is over, I promise. We'll find him.\n Chin up. I'm sure your brother's fine.\nPellam: We need to wait for Arlon. We'll want him fighting beside us.\n Your brother isn't here, and we need your mind fully engaged.\nYes, I understand. I'll do this. For the Grove.\n Good. That's all I need to hear.\n Arlon wouldn't be a coward. He'd charge in and solve this problem.\nI'm no coward! It's just...Arlon's always been the one to jump in head-first. But you're right. I'm in.\n That's better.\n I wish we could wait, but many sylvari are in danger. We must act.\nYou're right...I know you're right. Very well. I'm in.\n Good. We can't do it without you.\n Chin up. I'm sure your brother's fine.\nCaithe: The Ogotl are known for their noxious magical toxins. Fortunately, I know quite a bit about poisons myself.\n How do you know so much about poisons?\nI have not always fought alongside a guild—or a partner. When you are alone, any advantage can save your life.\n Makes sense. May I ask something else?\n I don't know if I feel reassured—or concerned.\n Do you know anything else about the \"Eye of the Sun?\"\nLittle. The hylek worship the sun. Anything they call its \"eye\" must be powerful, indeed.\n Good to know. May I ask another question?\n Well, that makes sense. Thanks, Caithe.\n I'm sure we'll defeat the Ogotl handily. No worries.\nTrahearne: It's imperative that we stop Tochzotl before he uses the zalisco extract.\n What else do you know about the \"Eye of the Sun\"? What's an \"avatar\"?\nAccording to hylek myth, it's extremely powerful—a hylek gifted with tremendous power, said to be blessed by the sun.\n Understood. May I ask you another question?\n Good to know. I'll bear that in mind.\n How dangerous is this situation?\nIf Tochzotl succeeds, he'll be a mad priest with tremendous power. If he fails, he'll poison the entire tribe—and the river. Grim, indeed.\n Understood. May I ask you another question?\n We'd better hurry.\n I'll head there at once.\n\n\n=== Venlin Vale ===\nTalking to the twins:\n\nArlon: This assault won't be easy. I hope we know what we're doing.\n We'll find a way.\nPellam: This assault won't be easy. I hope we know what we're doing.\n We'll find a way.\nCinematic at the Ogotl grounds:\n\n<Character name>: Trahearne, did you manage to create a counter-agent to the Eye of the Sun potion?\nTrahearne: I did the best I could, but it's little more than an educated guess.\nArlon: (if did The Direct Approach) Caithe scouted ahead and said that the river seemed...fouled. She went back out there to keep watch.\nPellam: (if did Trading Trickery) Caithe scouted ahead and said that the river seemed...fouled. She went back out there to keep watch.\n<Character name>: If the Ogotl poison the river, they could destroy the entire Caledon Forest! We've got to stop them.\nArlon: (if did The Direct Approach) Nothing's good about this situation. I...I wish Pellam was here. He'd have some clever idea to offer, I just know it.\nPellam: (if did Trading Trickery) Nothing's good about this situation. I...I wish Arlon was here. He'd be asking to rush bravely out in front, just like always.\n<Character name>: We can't wait for him. We have to stop the Ogotl before they finish making the Eye of the Sun.\nTrahearne: The Valiant is correct. I'm sorry, Arlon/Pellam. We must go - now.\nTalking to the NPCs:\n\nArlon: Pellam would have a plan for this. What do we do first? Gah! I feel so...lost!\n I'm worried about Pellam, too, but the Ogotl threat has to be contained.\nI know. Still, I can't help feeling that something horrible's happened to my brother. I hope we find him soon.\n We will, Arlon. I promise you that.\n Trust Trahearne. He'll find a way.\nPellam: Arlon would rush in bravely. No—I need to put him out of my mind. People are counting on me.\n I'm worried about Arlon, too, but the Ogotl threat has to be contained.\nI know. Still, I can't help feeling that something horrible's happened to my brother. I hope we find him soon.\n We will. I promise you that.\n Yes, on both of us.\nCaithe: We must go quietly, and prepare to fight. The Ogotl die—or we do.\n That could be too ruthless. What if they surrender?\nThen I'll try not to act surprised as I kill them. Or...fine. If they surrender, we'll take them to the Grove. Unharmed.\n Good. We should never give up hope that they'll see reason.\n So noted. Let's go.\nTrahearne: The Ogotl won't surrender easily. They believe the Sun demands obedience to the Speaker's plan.\n You're certain we shouldn't wait for the other twin?\nI wish we could, but the situation is dire. If the Ogotl succeed, many sylvari—and others—will die.\n I suppose you're right. Can I ask you something else?\n Nothing for it, then. Act with wisdom—but act.\n Can you tell me more about the counteragent?\nI haven't had time to test it, but it should harmlessly disperse the Ogotl poison.\n I'll hope for the best. Can I ask you something else?\n May the Mother Tree be with us. We're counting on you, Trahearne.\n Remind me—what's the \"Eye of the Sun,\" again?\nA potion that transforms you into an avatar of the sun. It'll either make the Ogotl Speaker very powerful—or backfire, poisoning the entire Caledon Forest.\n Got it. Can I ask you something else?\n I don't like either of those options. Let's stop these hylek—right now.\n Then we'll have to convince them otherwise.\nWhile investigating Ogotl grounds:\n\nCaithe: Be wary. This could be a trap.\nCaithe: This...isn't normal.\nCaithe: Poison. Hm. Let me try something else...\nCaithe: It seems your counter-reagent works. See? It clears the toxic fumes.\nTrahearne: That's a relief! Try applying it to the turret. If it works, we can use it to disperse that wall.\nCaithe: The land is sick with poison. We should stay on the move.\nCinematic at Ogotl Grounds:\n\nCaithe: The hylek poisons are extremely lethal. Impressive.\nArlon: (if did The Direct Approach) I see Pellam! Hang in there, twin! We'll get you out.\nPellam: (if did Trading Trickery) I see Arlon! Hang in there, twin! We'll get you out.\nTrahearne: Caithe, there's another turret! Use the counter-reagent!\nTochzotl: Ha ha! You cannot approach! My poison is powerful!\nWhile fighting hylek:\n\nTochzotl: Stay back, or I will drink the potion! I swear to you, I will do it!\nTochzotl: I have no choice! I must become the Eye of the Sun - and you must die!\nCinematic after clearing the poison:\n\nTochzotl: Fall to your knees, feeble creatures! Behold, the Eye of the Sun!\nCinematic after defeating Tochzotl:\n\nIf did The Direct Approach\nArlon: Pellam! Thorns! What have they done to you?\nPellam: The Ogotl...tested their toxin on me before they...put it in the river. I fell...sick...burned inside. I shouldn't have...tried to do it alone.\nArlon: No, it's my fault. I let you go instead of trying to find a compromise. You'll be fine, though, and from now on, we'll work as a team.\nTrahearne: Well done, Valiant. The twins have learned a valuable lesson. We're stronger together than apart.\n<Character name>: I'm just glad Pellam's going to be all right. Twins, if you'ld like, you can both stay in my garden for as long as you wish. you'll find it restful.\nArlon: What a generous offer. I think I can speak for us both when I say we would like nothing better. May the Dream bless you for helping us.\nIf did Trading Trickery\nPellam: Arlon! Thorns! What have they done to you?\nArlon: The Ogotl...tested their toxin on me... before they put it in the river. I fell...sick...burned inside. I shouldn't have...tried to do it alone.\nPellam: No, it's my fault. I let you go instead of trying to find a compromise. You'll be fine, though, and from now on, we'll work as a team.\nTrahearne: Well done, Valiant. The twins have learned a valuable lesson.

You'll find it restful.\nPellam: What a generous offer. I think I can speak for us both when I say we would like nothing better. May the Dream bless you for helping us.\nTalking to NPCs:\n\nArlon: (if The Direct Approach was completed) Poor Pellam! What did these monstrous frogs do to him? I'll slaughter them all!\n Revenge won't help. Like the tablet says: \"All things have the right to grow.\"\nYes...yes, you're right, <character name>. I shouldn't blame all hylek for the pain inflicted by a few. Thank you for reminding me to see reason.\n I'm glad. Now to the Grove and we'll see your brother healed.\n Come, Arlon. Let's get your brother home.\nArlon: (if Trading Trickery was completed) Valiant! Thank...the Pale Tree. I thought I'd never see a friendly face again.\n What did they do to you?\nThey used me as an experiment. Made me drink their horrible potions. My stomach... I feel so sick...\n We'll get you out of here. You can rest in the Grove.\n Come on. Let's get you home, Arlon.\nPellam: (if Trading Trickery was completed) Poor Arlon! What did these monstrous frogs do to him? They'll regret this.\n Revenge won't help. Like the tablet says: \"All things have the right to grow.\"\n Come. Let's get your brother home.\nCaithe: These hylek are as bad as asura. Poison. Experiments. Murder. When will they learn we're not the enemy?\n What do the asura have to do with this?\nWhen we first emerged from the tree, we thought to befriend the asura. Malomedies paid the price. Why? Why do the other races resist the good we bring?\n They will, in time. Who could resist the joy of our company?\nOnce, perhaps. Now...there is no joy in me, <character name>. Only efficiency. Come, let us leave this place.\n As you say.\n They don't trust us. Not until we prove ourselves.\nNo more \"proving myself.\" I'm ready to change the world. Enough is enough!\n As am I. Let's discuss this in the Grove.\n Why do we need other races? We are the dawn of a new age for Tyria!\nAh, <character name>, you do not yet understand how large the world is, and how small we truly are. You will realize the truth in time.\n Perhaps. I will bear that in mind, at least.\n No more dark thoughts. Time for us to leave this place.\n Come on, let's get out of here.\nTrahearne: The Ogotl have been defeated, and I recovered a bit of the original zalisco extract. We are fortunate, Valiant. Despite the cost.\n One of the brothers is ill from the Eye of the Sun potion. Will he recover?\nI believe so. The menders can create a better antidote from a sample of the zalisco. It may take time, but he'll recover.\n May I ask another question?\n Thank you, Trahearne. I'm glad to know that.\n What will happen to the other hylek tribes? The Dengatl and the Hazupl?\nThey will continue warring among themselves, no doubt. Some things never change.\n May I ask another question?\n I wish everyone could find a way to get along. Ah, well.\n I am glad to hear it. Come, let us return to the Grove, and share the news of our victory.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

After that, talk to Arlon and Pellam, who will insult each other, before saying you should go talk to Trahearne.\nGo back to the Grove and talk to Trahearne. Arlon and Pellam are still arguing. One of them wants to bust into the camp and attack, the other wants to get some magic weapons for trading.\nTrahearne puts you, the Valiant, in charge. You have to talk to the twins and choose a plan.

Welcome to Hanto Trading Post. Soar Goldbeak is the trademaster here. If anyone knows where to find the Dengatl, it will be him.\nPellam: Goldbeak won't tell us, though. He's greedy, and he keeps his secrets very well.We'll have to find some way to make him talk.\n<Character name>: I bet you both have ideas on how to do that, right?\nArlon: I favor the simple, direct route. We ask direct questions, and if nobody talks, we cause a commotion. They'll give us answers just to make us go away.\nPellam: Our search will be more fruitful if we use nectar instead of thorns. These are merchants. Why don't we try making a few deals?\n<Character name>: Before you two start making wild plans, let's talk to Soar Goldbeak. It can't hurt to ask.\nTraveling through the trading post:\n\nChief Dekkti: These joints are solid rust, you cranky, old, gout-geared junkpile! I should scrap this thing completely.\nHylek Merchant: Pine spirits for sale. Cleans weapons and wounds.\nIn a speech bubble:\n\nHylek Merchant: Pine spirits. Sharp and strong. If the bite doesn't kill you, the bark will.\nAt Soar Goldbeak:\n\nArlon: Tell us what you know about the Dengatl hylek, Goldbeak - or else!\nSoar Goldbeak: (laugh) You don't scare me, you barkless sprouts. I've got nothing to say to you.\nSoar Goldbeak: Get out of my way, and get out of my trading post. I've got legitimate business going on.\nTalking to Arlon and Pellam before Soar:\n\nPellam: Soar's a fussy one. Maybe you could talk to him? We've bugged him so much that I don't think he'll talk to us anymore.\n Fair point. I'll give it a try.\nArlon: You should be the one to talk to the tengu. He doesn't like me and my brother much.\n Oh, really? I wonder why. Irony, that.\nTalking to Soar Goldbeak:\n\nSoar Goldbeak: If you're with these two, I have nothing to say to you. Move along, sylvari.\n Can't you tell me more about the Dentagl hylek?\nThe Dentagl are a dangerous tribe. Why would I allow them in my trading post? They just cause trouble.\n Their money's still good. You could make quite a profit with them.\nLook, shrub. A lot of people come and go here. Talk to the merchants. I have work to do.\n Fine. We will.\n I'm not convinced. I need to ask you something else.\n Are those asuran merchants down the hill?\nNo, they're out here testing their newest inventions where other asura can't spy on them.\n What is that one testing?\nSome kind of arcanogolem, I think. All she does lately is mutter and curse.\n Have they been getting friendly with the hylek?\nNo. The asura claim the hylek have nothing worthwhile.\n That's very helpful, thank you.\n Interesting. Thanks for the info.\n I see. Thanks for the information.\n I'll be back.\nClosing the dialogue with Soar Goldbeak prior to learning about the Dengatl:\n\nPellam: Goldbeak clearly isn't telling us everything. Keep asking questions.\nAfter talking to Soar Goldbeak:\n\nArlon: The tengu's a stone wall. C'mon, let's cause some trouble. That'll make the merchants talk.\nPellam: Why do you have to be so dramatic? There are easier ways to get them to cooperate.\nArlon: You do it your way, I'll do it mine. We'll see who finds out more!\nApproaching Arlon:\n\nArlon: You know the Dengatl tribe, right? They stole our zalisco extract, and we want it back.\nHylek Merchant: You're the ones that got robbed, huh? I heard about that. Too bad for you.\nArlon: Where are the Dengatl? All you have to do is tell me what I want to know, and I'll go away.\nHylek Merchant: Get out of here, twig, before someone mistakes you for kindling and throws you on the fire.\nArlon: Kindling? I'll show you kindling! Valiant, help me burn something.\nIf you take too long to grab the torch:\n\nArlon: I know! Grab a stick from the campfire and ignite the barrels!\nArlon: Fine. I'll do it myself.\nTalking to Arlon:\n\nArlon: Set something on fire, Valiant. That'll get some attention!\n Well, I suppose...\nAfter burning goods:\n\nHylek Merchant: You, twigface! Get away from there! Those supplies are combustable!\nHylek Merchant: These sylvari are troublemakers. Get 'em, boys!\nCinematic after defeating hylek:\n\nHylek Merchant: My goods! Please, by the sun, stop! Look, I deal in stolen goods. My clients will kill me if they find out I talked about a robbery!\nArlon: You're not being very helpful. Maybe if we set the other pile of stuff on fire, too?\n<Character name>: That's enough, Arlon. I'll handle this. Listen to me, merchant. The zalisco sap is dangerous. If we don't find it, someone's going to get hurt.\nArlon: That's the spirit, Valiant!\n<Character name>: No - I mean innocents will get hurt when the Dengatl use the zalisco extract. We've got to stop them before that happens.\nHylek Merchant: Fine! I'll tell you. Sure, I heard about the robbery, but I didn't know the Dengatl stole anything poisonous.\nHylek Merchant: The Dengatl aren't planners, and they're not very smart. If they stole something dangerous, then someone told them to do it. Probably some other tribe.\nHylek Merchant: I don't know who, or why. Now please, stop burning my wares. I've got twenty-six kids to feed!\n<Character name>: Thank you, merchant, you did the right thing. Come on, Arlon, Let's go find Pellam.\nApproaching Pellam:\n\nHylek Merchant: Pine juice! Get your pine juice here! Good for drinking or for melting stains off your blade.\nPellam: Uh, excuse me, but have you seen any Dengatl hylek in the trading post today?\nHylek Merchant: Uhhh...I'm afraid I can't help you, little plantling. Please uh, go somewhere else.\nPellam: You sound frightened. Is everything all right?\nHylek Merchant: Fine! I'm fine. Just move along. Pine juice for sale!\nChief Dekkti: When I find out which of my rivals cast this rust spell on you, I swear, I'll have his diploma revoked!\nTalking to the NPCs:\n\nPellam: Did you notice that asura, Dekkti? Seems like her golem joints are rusted. Wonder if we can help?\n I'll look into it.\nApprentice Vee: I'm a bit busy at the moment, but you have my attention. What is it?\n What can you tell me about that hylek merchant across the way?\nSays he sells pine juice. Weird, right? You'd want to juice a pine?\n That is helpful, thank you.\n What do asura like to research?\nAnything! Everything! If it can't be done, we'll find a way to not-do-it better!\n Nice. Let me ask you something else? (returns to beginning)\n I see you're excited about your work. I'll let you get back to it.\n I'll let you get back to your work.\nKrewe Researcher: Can't you see I'm doing very delicate work?\n You sound annoyed. Has that hylek been bothering you?\nYou guessed it. He wanted to trade his...whatever...but our krewe leader wasn't interested. Now take your nosy questions elsewhere.\n If you insist.\n By the Tree, you're a rude one.\nHylek Merchant: Yes? What do you want, little sylvari?\n Are you hoping to trade with the asura?\nI'd very much like to sell my pine juice, but they're not interested.\n I'll talk to them about it.\n What do you have to trade?\nI use our alchemy to make a juice fit for parties and special occasions. It's also a great solvent!\n Fascinating. I don't need it, but I'll pass that along if anyone asks.\n That asura is wondering if your pine juice will work on her rusted golem. (only after talking to Chief Dekkti)\nIt's very good on rust. And on apple pie. Come on, we'll talk to her.\n I'll follow you.\n I was just saying hello.\nChief Dekkti: Be quick. I need to get this cog-sucking golem working again.\n What's wrong with your golem?\nBy the alchemy, it won't—glitch it—won't move! Its joints are stuck, and I'm out here in this backwater with no solvent!\n That hylek over there has a solvent that could do wonders for your golem. (only after talking to Hylek Merchant)\nWell, right now, I'll try anything. Bring our shovel-mouthed friend over here and let's talk business.\n Absolutely.\n Hm. That does sound like trouble.\n Why don't you trade with the hylek for the solvent?\nThat frog? Bah! I don't need useless poison, I need solvent.\n You never know until you try.\n Don't mind me. I'll let you go back to your work.\nAfter brokering deal between merchant and Dekkti:\n\nChief Dekkti: All right. Let's see that solvent of yours. I have to give it a try before we make a deal.\nHylek Merchant: Okay. Don't use much—just a little at a time will clear away the rust. Pine juice is very powerful.\nChief Dekkti: Yeah, yeah. A little dab here, a little dab there, and a big fat dab right—\nU.R.S.S.P.: Target - profile - established: Hylek—male. Preparing—murder—related—counter—procedures.\nCinematic after defeating U.R.S.S.P:\n\nChief Dekkti: This solvent is astromazing! I'll take your entire stock, hylek. I'll pay you whatever you want—twice that, if you don't sell it to anyone else!\nChief Dekkti: Oh, and, uh...sorry about that whole golem-trying-to-kill-you thing. I may have neglected to mention that it was in attack mode when it got stuck.\nChief Dekkti: By gum phosphorus—the solvent not only loosened the joints, it upped the golem's combat response rate! Brilliant!\nHylek Merchant: Sylvari, I am indebted to you. This arrangement will feed my family for many sunrises. How can I repay you?\n<Character name>: We need to know where to find the Dengatl tribe. They've stolen something from us, and we must get it back.\nHylek Merchant: The Dengatl tribe are very dangerous. You don't want to fight with them!\nPellam: I'm afraid we must—but I promise, we won't mention you told us anything. You'll be safe.\nHylek Merchant: Very well. The Dengatl never come into the trading post. Goldbeak meets them outside the camp. He buys stolen goods from them to sell at a profit.\nPellam: That's exactly the kind of thing we needed to know. Thank you, merchant.\nTalking to Arlon or Pellam before helping the other:\n\nArlon: Uh-oh. Pellam's wearing his \"scheming face.\" Nothing good can come of that. You'd better go see what he's up to.\n Good idea.\nPellam: Uh-oh. The way Arlon's eyeing that hylek merchant—you better go do something before he starts a fight.\n I hope this isn't a problem.\nSpeaking with the trading post denziens before speaking to Soar Goldbeak:\n\nChief Dekkti: That frog's pine juice is amazing! I may have to discover its chemical compound and magically synthesize...nah. Too much work. I'll focus on my golems.\n Your trade with that hylek has a beautiful future.\nHylek Merchant: Thank you! That asura certainly liked my pine juice. I'll have to bring twice as much next time!\n Glad I could help.\nApprentice Vee: Gadd's gizmos! What did you do to Dekkti's golem? It completely flipped out!\n We unfroze the joints with pine juice. A spectacular success!\nTalking to Soar Goldbeak again:\n\nSoar Goldbeak: If you're with these two, I have nothing to say to you. Move along, sylvari.\n What? I know you can tell us more about the Dengatl tribe of hylek. (triggers cinematic)\n Are those asuran merchants down the hill? (same as before)\n I'll be back.\nCinematic when confronting Soar Goldbeak:\n\n<Character name>: All right, Goldbeak. We know about your secret trades with the Dengatl, and we know they're working with another tribe.\n<Character name>: I'm betting you saw the Dengatl and this other tribe making a trade at that same location—our zalisco extract.\nSoar Goldbeak: So? They hylek tribes can do whatever they want. I'm not their boss.\n<Character name>: No, you're their patsy. The Dengatl don't like other races. They've got a powerful toxin, and when they use it—it won't be on hylek.\nSoar Goldbeak: What are you trying to say? That I'm in danger?\n<Character name>: We're all in danger. Look, we just want to retrieve the zalisco extract. Tell us, and we won't turn you in for selling stolen goods.\nSoar Goldbeak: All right! You drive a hard bargain, sylvari. Yes, the Dengatl sell me stolen goods, but when they wouldn't make a deal for one of the boxes, I hid and watched.\nSoar Goldbeak: I wanted to know who was undercutting me. All I saw was a bunch of frogs talking about the 'Eye of the Sun.' I don't even know if they made the trade.\nSoar Goldbeak: I'll tell you where the Dengatl village is, but that's it—I'm not involved, you hear me?\nWith Arlon and Pellam:\n\nPellam: Arlon! Did you set fire to that poor merchant's goods?\nArlon: He was a crook! Anyway, it got him to talk, and nobody got hurt.\nArlon: Did you con that asura into using pine juice as a solvent?\nPellam: I did, and it worked like a charm.\nArlon: Except for the bruising you took from the golem! (laughs)\nPellam: You've the brains of a wilted fern, Arlon. Valiant, head back to the Grove. We need to tell Trahearne what we've discovered.\nTalking to Arlon:\n\nArlon: Let him go, <character name>. We need to head back to Trahearne. Oh, and about that hylek... I wouldn't have been so mean if she wasn't such a crook.\n What makes you think the hylek is a crook?\nPellam and I have dealt with her before. She was trying to sell melons as \"pre-shrunk sylvari housing.\"\n Wow, she is a crook! Thanks for letting me know.\n Good to know. See you back at the Grove.\n\n\n=== Dreamer's Terrace ===\nCinematic upon approaching Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: There you are Valiant. Arlon and Pellam were telling me what you discovered at the trading post.\nTrahearne: The one thing we all agree on is that we must find out who bought the zalisco from the Dengatl tribe.\nArlon: Soar Goldbeak told us where to find the Dengatl village. We could go there, break in, and make them tell us.\nPellam: Just crash through their defenses and hope we survive? Are you crazy, Arlon? We don't have to hurt them!\nPellam: The Dengatl trade with Goldbeak. I bet they'd be willing to trade with us if we had something they want. Magic weapons, maybe.\nArlon: We don't have the time to get magic weapons, Pellam! We need to do something now, or people could die!\nArlon: Act with wisdom, but act!\nPellam: All things have a right to grow!\nTrahearne: By the Pale Tree! Valiant, they'll argue forever. I'm putting you in charge. Choose a plan and get started.\nSpeaking with your allies:\n\nTrahearne: Either plan could succeed, but not if the twins are left to their own devices. I trust you to make the decision.\n I'll choose carefully. Thank you, Firstborn.\nArlon: We worked well together back there. You hit problems head-on, just like me.\n Tell me more about your plan?\nWe know where the Dengatl are, so let's rush in and bash their froggy heads together. Simple.\n I'll choose your plan. It's the most straightforward option. (Leads to The Direct Approach.)\n I need to give it some thought.\n What do you think about Pellam's suggestion?\nBeg them to leave their houses and then... what? Cry till they give in? C'mon, <Character name>, be realistic.\n As direct with your opinion as you are with your weapon. Noted.\n Thanks. I do my best.\nPellam: You handled that hylek-asura negotiation extremely well, Valiant. I'm eager to ally with you against the Dengatl.\n Perhaps. Tell me more about your plan?\nWe need to draw the Dengatl out, away from their fortifications, and trick them into giving us the zalisco.\n I agree. I'll go with you. (Leads to Trading Trickery.)\n Let me think about it just a little longer.\n What do you think of Arlon's proposal?\nWade in and punch everything? Do you really think we can take on a whole tribe of hylek?\n Hm. You two really are very different, aren't you?\n I need to consider this decision a bit longer.\nIf Arlon's plan is chosen:\n\nPellam: When you're done being foolish, I'll meet you back here... and I'll have the zalisco extract with me.\nIf Pellam's plan is chosen:\n\nArlon: Good luck sweet-talking them out of mass murder. I'd rather let my sword do the job.\nSpeaking with your allies again:\n\nTrahearne: The brothers argue more than ever. I thought this responsibility would bring them closer, but all it's done is break them apart.\n How is this situation affecting Arlon?\nHe grows more aggressive, more eager to prove himself in combat. He's rushing into things.\n I'll bear that in mind.\n What's Pellam doing? Is he upset?\nVery. He thinks that Arlon's risking too much—and that causes Pellam to draw back, seeking safer routes.\n Good to know.\n It's been difficult for all of us, but I can still salvage the situation.\nArlon: You made the right call, <character name>! We'll be in and out of there in a flash. The zalisco will be ours.\n Sounds like a plan.\nPellam: You made the right choice. I'll meet you in Wychmire Swamp.\n I'll see you there.\n\n\n== My story ==",

The Pale Tree summons you.\n<Character name>: Is there a problem? It sounds like there's a commotion in the Omphalos Chamber.\nCaithe: Those are the emissaries of the three Orders of Tyria. There is a...situation.\n<Character name>: The Orders of Tyria? Who are they, and what's going on?\nCaithe: The orders are organized groups that work against the Elder Dragons. The Vigil, the Durmand Priory, and the Order of Whispers.\nCaithe: Zhaitan's might is growing. Its undead minions rise on the beaches of Kryta and the Tarnished Coast.\n<Character name>: Why are the emissaries arguing? What am I walking into?\nCaithe: To the north, Overlake Haven is in danger of being overrun. The Lionguard are outmatched by Risen troops.\nCaithe: We sylvari realize that all life is intertwined. If Zhaitan threatens one race, he threatens us all.\n<Character name>: Then why are the orders arguing? Why don't they just do something about it?\nCaithe: We think alike, you and I. Let us speak with the Mother Tree.\nArriving in the Omphalos Chamber:\n\nBranthyn: Munition golems? You want to fight the Elder Dragons with toys and dollies?\nIowerth: Better than throwing away sylvari lives on a direct assault.\nBranthyn: No one's throwing away lives. Vigil soldiers are the best-trained fighting force in Tyria!\nTrahearne: Valiant, I'm glad you're here. They've been going on like this for an hour.\nTrahearne: Everyone, please be silent. We are all assembled, and the Mother Tree wishes to speak.\nTalking to NPCs before the Avatar of the Tree:\n\nCaithe: No time for pleasantries, Valiant. Attend the Tree.\n I shall.\nCai: Hail, <Character name>. Things around here are starting to get interesting, don't you think?\n I need to find out what's going on. Excuse me.\nCinematic with emissaries upon approaching the Avatar of the Tree:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Greetings, Valiant. Today, you take the next steps on the journey of your Wyld Hunt.\nAvatar of the Tree: Zhaitan's forces are gathering at Overlake Haven. The orders wish to defend the location, but their plans differ.\nAvatar of the Tree: Valiant, I name you to be my herald in this matter. The Grove can only back one of these plans. May your Dream guide your decision.\n<Character name>: I am honored, Mother Tree. I will do my best.\nBranthyn: My name is Branthyn. I represent the Vigil. We can have a platoon arrayed at Overlake Haven immediately. Our soldiers can handle this situation.\nBranthyn: In the Vigil, we prefer to fight our enemies head-on. The best way to protect the haven is to provide military force.\nIowerth: You're asking to risk countless lives. Herald, the Durmand Priory proposes a far safer course of action. My name is Iowerth.\nIowerth: The Priory wants to utilize experimental munitions golems to destroy the undead. We'll have no soldiers on the field at all.\nBranthyn: Completely untested munitions golems! You're the one risking lives. What if your golems fail?\n<Character name>: And you, emissary? You've been quiet through the whole argument.\nCai: I'm Cai, and I represent the Order of Whispers. I brought this situation to the Pale Tree's attention, but I'll leave the front-line fighting to the others.\n<Character name>: Very well. Give me a moment to think this over, and then I'll decide.\nTalking to NPCs before choosing an order to assist:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Act as my herald, and use the wisdom you have gained. The orders shall trust your judgment, as I do.\n Can you tell me more about the orders?\nThree powerful coteries of individuals, each dedicated to fighting the dragons. Their methods are distinct, but their hearts are all true.\n What are their methods?\nThe Durmand Priory are scholars and explorers. The Vigil are soldiers and caretakers. The Order of Whispers are spies and manipulators.\n I see. Let me ask you something else.\n Thank you, Mother. Farewell.\n Do you favor any of them?\nEach order is unique, but their goal is the same: protect Tyria. I honor that with support for all three.\n I see. May I ask something else?\n I understand. Thank you, Mother.\n Thank you for trusting me with this, Mother Tree.\nCai: Trouble, trouble everywhere. You don't yet know the half of it, Valiant.\n What do you mean? Do you know something you're not telling?\nNothing that'll make a difference. You go look into this haven matter. I'll be here when you get back. Maybe we'll talk then.\n What can you tell me about the Order of Whispers? (same as below)\n All right, I suppose.\n What can you tell me about the Order of Whispers?\nThe Order seeks to subtly influence the world's races and unify them against the dragons.\n Influence? You mean manipulate. Sounds like a lot of trouble.\n Makes sense.\n I'll keep my eyes open. Thanks.\nCaithe: Undead assaulting a fortified haven so openly? Something is driving them. Something dangerous.\n I'll watch for any sign of it.\nTrahearne: There's a problem at Overlake Haven.\n Are you part of an order?\nNo, but I have worked with each of them, and I respect them a great deal.\n Why haven't you joined an order?\nOrr consumes all of my time. I cannot remain here on the continent while the land there cries out for aid.\n I understand.\n I believe so. I'll check it out.\nBranthyn: Valiant <Character name>. I've heard impressive things about you. Like me, you never turn your back on a challenge, eh?\n Before I decide, can you tell me more about your plan?\nA Vigil squad punches through the undead sieging the haven. Once we've liberated the haven, a combined assault will be plenty to mop up the enemy.\n Not bad. What do you think of the Priory's golems? (same as \"I see that you don't think highly of the Priory's plan.\")\n Your plan is solid. Let's do it.\n I'll get back to you on this.\n I see that you don't think highly of the Priory's plan.\nThis is war, not kiddie-playground time! Experiments? Bah. On the battlefield, you need trust, not...dabbling!\n Tell me your plan one more time? (same as \"Before I decide, can you tell me more about your plan?\")\n You've got me convinced. We'll do it your way.\n I need some time to think this over.\n Can you tell me more about the Vigil?\nThe Vigil is a militia composed of all the races of Tyria. We fight the dragons, and we protect the innocent.\n That's good to know. I'm looking forward to learning more.\n Good to know. Hm. I need some more time before I decide.\n I need to think about this\nIowerth: I'm glad you're considering the more innovative option. The Durmand Priory prizes sharp minds like yours, Valiant.\n Thanks. What can you tell me about these experimental munitions golems?\nI'd hate to spoil the surprise, but they're exceptional. Mine-laying, explosive-repercussion just need a field test or three.\n You think they're better than the Vigil's plan? (same as \"It sounds like you don't think highly of the Vigil's plan.\")\n I'm convinced. Let's use the golems.\n I need a moment to decide.\n It sounds like you don't think highly of the Vigil's plan.\nHmph. Do you really call \"hit them until they're dead\" a plan? Why risk so many soldiers when we have golems?\n Experimental golems. What do they do, again?\n I'm in. We'll use the golems.\n I need to think about this.\n Can you tell me a little more about the Durmand Priory, first?\nI certainly can! We are Tyria's most elite scholars and archeologists. We search for lore to use against the dragons.\n Makes sense. May I ask something else?\n Good to know. I'm looking forward to learning more.\n I'll get back to you on this.\nAfter a choice has been made:\n\nCai: I'll be watching how things go. When you get back, we'll talk.\n Before I go, tell me about the Order of Whispers.\nInformation is our trade. Along with other intriguing things. You'll learn more about us soon.\n I can't wait.\n I'll remember you said that. Thanks.\nIf the Vigil plan is chosen\n\nBranthyn: I'm glad to see you have courage, Herald. You'll be an asset to the haven's defense.\nBranthyn: I will rally the Vigil troops and meet you near Overlake Haven.\nIowerth: Don't worry, Branthyn. The Priory will have our munitions golems ready if you fail.\nBranthyn: Excellent choice. Together, we'll wreck those walking piles of rot and liberate the haven!\n I look forward to it!\nIowerth: A shame. Well, best of luck to you and the Vigil.\n Thank you. That's very gracious.\nTrahearne: Vigil assaults can be dangerous, but with courage, they deliver unquestionable results. Good luck.\n Are you part of an order?\nNo, but I have worked with each of them, and I respect them a great deal.\n Why haven't you joined an order?\nOrr consumes all of my time. I cannot remain here on the continent while the land there cries out for aid.\n I understand.\n Noted. Thank you.\nIf the Durmand Priory plan is chosen\n\nIowerth: Excellent choice, Herald. Trust me, you'll be very impressed with the Priory's plan.\nIowerth: Scholar Kekt and the munitions golems will meet you at Overtake Haven.\nBranthyn: Enjoy playing with your little toys, Iowerth. If it goes badly, the Vigil will be here.\nBranthyn: A shame. Would've liked to see you on the battlefield. Maybe some other time?\n Perhaps. Take care.\nIowerth: Excellent. I'll meet you near Overlake Haven. Our golems will put those soldiers to shame!\n I appreciate the enthusiasm. See you there.\nTrahearne: I'm curious about these \"experimental golems\" and how they fare against the undead. I wish you luck.\n Are you part of an order?\nNo, but I have worked with each of them, and I respect them a great deal.\n Why haven't you joined an order?\nOrr consumes all of my time. I cannot remain here on the continent while the land there cries out for aid.\n I understand.\n Thank you.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis part of the story introduces you to the three orders; you are not making a final decision about which to join.",

Hronk's got us all set up. Well, mostly.\nTalking to Kazz:\n\nKazz: Quick, Hronk is waiting for us. He says he's got a way to track down the golem. I just hope Doxa's all right inside that thing. I'd be lost without her, you know. She keeps me on my toes.\n Then let's talk to Hronk about getting her back.\nCinematic with Hronk:\n\nHronk: Before we proceed, I want to make it clear: we won the Snaff Prize, but we can't decide who gets the \"Snaff Savant\" title until we recover Doxa and the MIG.\nHronk: Now, then: I just finished calibrating my Aetheric Harmonizer for the tracking device in the MIG. Once we activate it, it'll pinpoint Doxa's location.\nKazz: Then what are we waiting for? I mean: please, sir, let's activate it right away. I'm worried about Doxa.\nHronk: I can see that. But I'm worried that your...personal concerns are distracting you. The startup sequence is more complicated than flipping a switch, you know.\nHronk: Ergo, I want you on the harmonizer core to make sure the apparatus doesn't overload, while your krewmate here fires it up.\n<Character name>: Consider it done, sir. Kazz isn't the only one who needs Doxa back. She's funny, and without her, our productivity has dropped by 43 percent.\nAfter cinematic:\n\nHronk: I'll begin the initiation sequence. Note which console fires in what order, then repeat the sequence by interacting with the consoles.\nTalking to Hronk:\n\nHronk: I change the startup sequence twice a day to baffle spies and saboteurs. Troublesome, yes, but necessary for security.\n I'll handle it.\nDuring the sequence mini-game:\n\nHronk: Okay, you've got basic motor function and eye/hand coordination down. Now it gets tough.\nHronk: Brace yourself. This last one is going to knock you flat.\nHronk: It's working! It's working perfectly! And the signal appears to be close!\nHronk: No, no, no: wrong! But keep trying. (anytime you get a sequence wrong)\nAfter the mini-game:\n\nHronk: The signal is moving. In fact...it's getting closer! In fact, it's headed right for us!\nHronk: Wait, this can't be right. It says the signal is coming from right behind that wall.\nM.I.G.: Access—granted.\nDuring the fight with the M.I.G.:\n\nM.I.G.: Entity—not—found. Searching...\nM.I.G.: Kazz... Kazz? Negative. Resuming—search.\nM.I.G.: Entity—detected. Close—proximity. Query: Kazz?\nKazz: Doxa? What are you doing? We've got to weaken the golem, or we'll never calm her down.\nM.I.G.: Kaaaazz!\nCinematic after defeating the M.I.G.:\n\nKazz: Did you hear that? Doxa was in there, calling for me. But why was she so out of control, so destructive?\n<Character name>: Her mind has been fused with the MIG's command protocols. She's confused, in pain, and struggling to adjust to a whole new consciousness.\n<Character name>: I'd say that's also why she went berserk at the demonstration: the initial shock must have been painful. I hate to say it, but getting her out will be tricky.\nHronk: A definite understatement. I've reviewed reams of recovered Inquest records, and according to them no one has ever been un-fused from a golem.\nHronk: I'm sorry, Kazz, but Doxa may already be dead. Those words you heard could just be echoes of her former self.\n<Character name>: Don't panic yet. Zojja is the foremost authority on golems in the world, and she already stated her interest in the MIG. If anyone can help, it's her.\nHronk: Perhaps there's hope, then. I know Zojja's doing some work at the Incomp Optics lab outside the city. You'd better follow up with her in person.\nKazz: I'm ready. Please, for Doxa's sake, let's talk to Zojja right away.\nTalking to your krewe:\n\nKazz: Doxa being stuck inside our golem is suboptimal, to say the least. There will be plenty of time to blame and punish the Inquest later, but for now:how do we get her out?\n I'm not sure yet, but we are problem-solvers. All we need is time.\nHronk: I've done all I can for Doxa from here. The rest is field work, which I am hereby delegating to you and Kazz.\n Leave it to us. The Snaff Prize is as much Doxa's as ours.\nThat reminds me, we still haven't chosen who gets the \"Snaff Prize Savant\" title. Usually it's the most valuable inventor on the project.\n Let's take care of Doxa first.\n We won't let you down.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe name of this story is a reference to the Global Positioning System, a satellite-based navigation system.",

Zojja is hopeful that Doxa can be extracted from the golem without killing her. Turn on the extractor when prompted. Unsurprisingly, the Inquest will appear in the lab shortly after starting the extraction process.

There is no way the etheric filtering could process that much energy!\nCitizen (2): I hear someone's trying to improve on asura gates. As if that were possible.\nCitizen (3): If it's not broken, you're not innovating.\nUpon approaching your allies:\n\nKazz: Be honest now, Zojja. Can this work? Do we have a chance?\nZojja: Yes. My simulations result in an 86 percent probability of success, but this is Inquest territory.\nZojja: They don't care about their test subjects, and they focus on fusing rather than unfusing.\nZojja: Still, 86 percent is nothing to sneeze at. The modifications we made should do the trick.\nHronk: It's time to test that theory. We're ready to start the extraction process. All we need to do now is throw the switch.\nHronk: And, activate the extractor...now!\nBefore throwing the switch:\n\nZojja: Now that we're all here, we can begin. This is going to be both exciting and informative.\nTalking to allies:\n\nZojja: Extracting Doxa will be risky, but you made the right choice. Also, I love that we're undoing something that cost the Inquest a lot of time.\n If it works... and it will. I won't let Doxa down.\nKazz: The anxiety is killing me. Please, let's get this over with before I lose my nerve.\n Don't worry. Doxa is as good as saved.\nHronk: I'm still not comfortable with this, even though there's a pleasing symmetry to using Inquest methods and machinery to clean up their mess. I just hope we get results.\n We will. Between you, Zojja, and myself, we can't fail.\nAfter throwing the switch:\n\nKazz: I hear noises and see light, but what does it all mean? Is it working?\nHronk: The machines are working. As for the overall process, we'll see soon enough.\nHronk: Bookah boogers, it's the Inquest! Don't let them interrupt the extraction process.\nDuring the battle:\n\nHronk: Stay focused. Don't let them interrupt the extraction process.\nHronk: We're making progress. Keep them at bay just a little while longer.\nHronk: Nearly there!\nWhen Doxa is freed:\n\nDoxa: Whew! From now on, I'm carrying an industrial strength can opener.\nZojja: It worked—Doxa's free. Now both she and the MIG should function properly.\nKazz: Thank the Eternal Alchemy...and you, Zojja. And our krewemates. Are you alright, Doxa my dear?\nDoxa: (in robotic voice) Affirmative, loved one Kazz. This unit thanks you for your assistance.\n(Pause)\nDoxa: Ha! I had you going there, didn't I? I'm fine. And my sense of humor is definitely intact.\nCinematic with Teyo:\n\nTeyo: Plagiarists! Saboteurs! That's Inquest property. I've come to shame you into giving it back. Oh, and snuff you all for stealing it.\nZojja: You couldn't snuff a sputtering candle. And before I forget: Plagiarists? Saboteurs? Coming from you and the Inquest, that's hilarious.\nTeyo: You broke into our facility to steal our research for a golem design you also stole. What would you call it?\n<Character name>: We'd call it saving our friend. I'll answer for stealing your tech when you answer for using it to commit atrocities.\nZojja: What do you say, Teyo? Shall we all go before the Arcane Council and see whose golem fusion project is most questionable?\nTeyo: Hmmm. No deal. I guess I'll just have to take back what's mine and eliminate all you witnesses.\nCinematic after defeating Teyo:\n\nHronk: Well done, krewe. We saved Doxa and beat the Inquest at its own game. I've never been so proud. Everyone gets an extra hour for lunch tomorrow!\n<Character name>: That's...generous, sir, but I think Doxa and Kazz may need more time that that. They've been through a lot. Don't worry,[sic] though: I'll cover their duties.\nDoxa: Thanks for that. I feel like I could sleep for a year. And when ever I try to think, I still hear a metallic voice in my head that says, \"Work-ing.\"\nKazz: It could be worse. If things had gone differently, you could have been reduced to a voice in the MIG's head. And then who would keep me honest?\n<Character name>: Go on, you two. Enjoy some downtime. I'll keep things running smoothly until you're ready to return.\nHronk: Before we let these lovers go, we still have to decide who gets the title \"Snaff Prize Savant.\" I can't see anyone objecting to it being you.\nHronk: You were instrumental in constructing the MIG, and in getting Doxa out of it. Any objections? No? Good! Wear your title with pride. You've earned it.\nZojja: Congratulations, Savant. I'll be keeping an eye on you. Standouts like you are worth watching...and worth putting to work. See you soon.\nTaslking to allies again:\n\nZojja: Quite an outing. A Snaff Prize Victory, a heroic rescue or two, and we exposed the Inquest as uninspired idea-thieves. Congratulations, <Character Name>. I'll be keeping an eye on you.\n I'm flattered, and I predict you'll like what you see.\nDoxa: Ugh, trapped inside that metal... the extra weight, the clanging echo in my head, the body-wide chaffing... I'm not wearing anything heavier than silk for a year.\n Glad to have you back, Doxa. You may have been uncomfortable, but you wore it well.\nKazz: Without Doxa, my life is like a box of wet matches: no spark, no flame, no point. Saying \"thank you\" doesn't even begin to cover it.\n Don't mention it. You're both part of my krewe.\nHronk: I expect you'll go off and pursue your own projects. That's the way it goes. Genius never stands still. On behalf of Kazz and Doxa and the whole krewe: great working with you, <Character Name>.\n Thanks, chief.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Age and experience always triumph.\nVarkk: Give it up. I taught you everything you know, but I didn't teach you everything I know.\nVarkk: My future...my Council seat...all is lost...\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\nZojja: Mr. Sparkles made sure the rest of the Council got to safety. They know all about Varkk's extracurricular activities.\n<Character name>: Good. I hope they annul all of his achievements and strike his name from the roster of geniuses.\nZojja: They'll probably just sweep it under the rug like usual. Anything that makes the Council look bad gets buried in paperwork and bureaucracy.\nZojja: But Varkk got his, and that's something. Now we need to deal with Inquest and recover your teleporter gun.\n<Character name>: Nothing would please me more. Do you know where it is?\nZojja: At Rana Landing. Meet me there, and Teyo will pay for ambushing our ambush. I see explosions and dead Inquest in our future!\nSpeaking with Zojja:\n\nZojja: We settled things with Varkk and Mr. Sparkles got the Arcane Council to safety...all that's left is to avenge your friend, recover your translocator, and trample Teyo.\n What will the Council say about what just happened to Varkk?\nSome may thank us for removing a potentially evil councillor, others for removing a potential political threat. Councillors Haia and Yahk will probably take it the hardest.\n Why were they so supportive of a snake like Varkk?\nYahk is the Inquest's mouthpiece on the Council. He does their bidding, makes sure important votes go their way. He's no genius, nor even effective administrator. Just a sad little weasel.\n What about Haia?\nDon't buy her \"sweet old granny\" act: she's as mean, sharp, and ruthless as they come. If she was cozying up to Varkk, she had a use for him in mind.\n Too bad Varkk's useless since we caught up with him.\n Sounds good to me. I'll see you in Rana Landing.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Defeat the agent and then talk to them to trigger a cutscene - this signals the start of a defense/offense phase in the mission where you can use turrets or mines (from the two carts by the entrance to the mission) to defend against the waves of Inquest coming out of the asura gate. You can place up to eight turrets, which makes the mission very easy as the Inquest will likely be entirely subdued by the turrets. You can use mines too, but they will need to be set up for each wave since they only trigger once.

That thing the VOED found for us is amazing!\nKozzak: Also you were right: it's part of a larger whole or a...matched set. Or something. Anyway, there have to be more like this one out there.\nPokka: We've synchronized the detection wave with our larger global positioning system to achieve long and short ranged scanning capability.\n<Character name>: So the global system gets us in range, then the VOED pinpoints the exact location. Perfect! When can we go after the other pieces?\nPokka: That right there is why you're my krewe chief. We're almost done calibrating the global system. Once we have coordinates, we can head out and start picking up the pieces.\nKozzak: Hear that, Shrieksy? We're going on a relic hunt!\nSpeaking with your allies:\n\nKozzak: The VOED could win us the next Snaff Prize, too. As long as it keeps leading us to powerful artifacts, it's an endless source of research.\n Let's verify this find before we make any plans.\nPokka: Between the lab's resources and our top-notch brainpower, this should be a snap. Let's begin the analysis.\n I'm ready.\nAt Pokka after the cinematic:\n\nKozzak: It'll be fun to get cranking again! I wonder if—\nStatics Security Golem: Alert. Unauthorized—intruder—detected. Engaging.\nPokka: One of the security golems has entered alert mode. Check it out!\nAfter defeating the Inquest intruder:\n\nStatics Security Golem: Unauthorized—intruder—has—been—neutralized. Please—restrain—and—interrogate.\nSpeaking with your allies:\n\nKozzak: I was taught to work hard, achieve things, secure proper credit and finances, then share. Simple. But the Inquest just steals and hoards. Why are they such jerks?\n They don't like hard work, but they love credit and benefits.\nPokka: Can't talk right now, <Character name>. Got my hands full.\n Okay, it can wait.\nCinematic with the Inquest Infiltrator:\n\nInquest Infiltrator: Idiots. You think you've beaten us? Ha! I was the Easy Way. Now we'll just have to do things the Hard Way.\nInquest Infiltrator: Nothing can prepare you for the unfettered fury that is the Inquest Attack Squad. Go on, beg and plead, void your bowels in terror. It'll do you no good.\nKozzak: This guy's a few anodizing terminals short of a coating array. I say we feed him to Shrieksy.\n<Character name>: The Inquest has never had any interest in our krewe's research until now. They must want whatever the VOED is detecting.\nPokka: Or the VOED itself. I, for one, am not inclined to give them either.\n<Character name>: Agreed. Ma'am, if you can gather everyone else at the front entrance, Kozzak and I will handle the rest.\n<Character name>: And by that I mean we'll mine the entrance to give the Inquest a nice, warm welcome. We'd better hurry—if this maniac is right, they're already on their way.\nSpeaking with the Inquest Infiltrator again:\n\nInquest Infiltrator: You'll pay, punk. The Inquest never forgets a slight!\n The only thing slight around here is your intellect.\nBefore the first wave of the Inquest:\n\nPokka: If I know the Inquest, they'll send golem shock troops in first to soften us up.\nPokka: We'll only see the Inquest if we manage to survive their golem attack.\nStatics Security Golem: Alert.

They're sending in another team.\nPokka: We're in for it now. Here come their attack squad!\nPokka: Looks like they still have some fight in them. Hold steady!\nPokka: Stay alert. More of those Inquest jackanapes are headed our way.\nCinematic with Teyo:\n\nTeyo: Well played, Pokka. Time for the hardest way: we've planted explosives all along the cliffs overhead. Give me the artifact or we'll bury this place.\nKozzak: You skritt-shaving devils. You'd threaten this entire community, all these innocent people, just to steal our discovery?\n<Character name>: It's all right, Kozzak. Let them have it. It's not worth the risk.\nTeyo: Spoken like a true also-ran. \"Snaff Prize winner.\" Ha! I'd pity your weakness, if it wasn't so amusing. Thanks for the treasure, losers!\nPokka: That was very slick, Savant. Let them have that piece. We know there are more, and we still have the VOED. We can collect them before the Inquest does.\n<Character name>: And then we force Teyo to give us back the first one. Pokka, I'd like Zojja to join us. We're going to need all the help we can get.\nPokka: Capital idea! You and Zojja handle the search. I'll send word to Zojja and have her standing by. Kozzak and I will start cleaning up here.\nSpeaking with your allies prior to leaving:\n\nPokka: Feculent Inquest monkeys! Storming in here, threatening the innocent, demanding the fruits of our labor—get out there and teach them not to mess with Snaff Prize winners.\n Consider it done.\nKozzak: I'm not the sharpest krewe member, but it sure felt good outsmarting the Inquest. With the VOED on our side, we'll be so far ahead they'll never catch up.\n That's the plan.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Better leave it to Zojja.\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\n<Character name>: I got your message. It was a tad on the cranky side, even for you. What's on your mind?\nZojja: Violence. What do you know about a wretched little pipsqueak name Kudu? Cross-reference \"criminal,\" \"megalomaniac,\" and \"plagiarist.\"\n<Character name>: I've heard of him. He's an Inquest bigwig now, but he used to be Snaff's apprentice. Then you came along and Snaff traded up.\nZojja: That's him. Now, out of pure spite, Kudu's invited me to watch him demonstrate some sort of weather-changing device for the Arcane Council.\n<Character name>: My first invention was a weather-changer. I called it the Variable Atmospheric Conditioner. Good ol' VAC. It got me accepted to college.\n<Character name>: It was pretty rough, but it worked...mostly. And if Kudu is using my invention without giving me credit, I'll call him out in front of the whole council.\nZojja: I was hoping you'd say that. Get a copy of your blueprints from the archives. We'll wipe the smug little smirk off Kudu's insufferable face.\nSpeaking with Zojja:\n\nZojja: That twerp Kudu won't get away with this. I'm going to ram my fist down his throat and punch his stomach.\n Who's Kudu, again?\nWhat, were you educated in an electroshock lab? He was another of Snaff's apprentices. Now he's part of the Inquest.\n Can I ask you something else?\n Good to know. Let's get going!\n What's this demonstration all about?\nKudu's beta-testing some kind of weather machine. It's based on your specs—he thinks you aren't bold enough to step up and call him a plagiarist. But we know better, don't we?\n Can I ask you something else?\n Good to know. Let's get going!\n Arcane whosiwatsis? Who are they?\nHave you been inhaling brian-cleaner? The Arcane Council are the leaders of the most important krewes in Rata Sum. They rule the city.\n Can I ask you something else?\n Good to know. Let's get going!\n No one steals from me and gets away with it.\n\n\n=== Open World ===\nSpeaking with Archivist Grep at Thamaturgic Calculus:\n\nArchivist Grep: What can I do for you?\n I need to look up a blueprint for a \"Variable Atmospheric Conditioner.\"\nOne moment, please. I'm sorry. I can't find any information about such a device in our records.\n What? There should be a patent on file. It was my first, so I'd remember.\nWorry not, we keep physical backups of all patents at our secondary facility. I'm sure we'll have a copy of your patent there.\n I'll go check it out. Thank you.\n\n\n=== At Desider Atum ===\nApproaching the archives:\n\nResearcher: (cough) Can't...breath. Smoke...choking me. Sentences...halting.\nResearcher: Fire! Inquest! And, I've got a stomachache!\nInquest Golemancer: Yeah! Burn it all! Every last bit of it!\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\nZojja: I'm glad you're here. I heard Kudu's lackeys were going to attack the archive annex. Looks like I heard right.\nZojja: Kudu knows what he's doing. I'll give him that. The fire started in the records room, and all the Peacemaker golems had been deactivated.\n<Character name>: He's one step ahead of us, then. The blueprints for my weather device are also missing from the archives. The only backups were stored in this annex...\nZojja: ...which is on fire. Come on! Without those blueprints, the trail leading to Kudu goes up in smoke.\nWhile fighting Inquest:\n\nInquest Technician: Hold it right there, pal. Nobody gets past us.\nInquest Technician: This is Inquest business. Don't interfere.\nInquest Technician: You can't stop us, ya brainless nincompoop!\nInquest Grenadier: It's nearly gone. Fan those flames! Make it burn faster!\nCinematic after fight:\n\n<Character name>: We're too late. The evidence we needed to prove Kudu stole my idea is now a pile of ashes, soot, and failure.\nZojja: Not a failure: a setback. Now that we know Kudu's up to something big, we just need to figure out what it is and how to stop it.\n<Character name>: I'm ready. Plagiarism and arson are one thing, but wiping out all records of my very first invention? I'm going to tattoo Kudu's butt with bootprints.\nZojja: That's what I like to hear. One of Kudu's lackeys has a lab nearby. Her name is Plunka, and I bet she still smells like smoke.\nZojja: Meet me at Plunka's lab. I predict she's just dying to tell us why Kudu wants your weather changer.\nSpeaking with Zojja:\n\nZojja: Maybe Plunka will have more information. I hope for her sake that she does.\n Arson, theft, and intellectual property mismanagement! How does Kudu get away with it?\nHe was Snaff's apprentice, and people assume he's a class-A genius. They're wrong, but they're also stupid.\n Fine. But I'm not giving up so easy.\n Kudu stole my idea! Can't we take this to some kind of patent police?\nWe are the patent police. And by that I mean we have to handle our own problems. We're asura, after all.\n If that's the way it works, then I'm going to \"handle\" this all the way to the end. Let's go.\n\n\n== My story ==",

Hurry and get over here, it's important.\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\nZojja: Thanks for coming by. Quick question for you: your first invention was a service golem, correct?\n<Character name>: Now that takes me back. My blueprints for the VAL-A got me accepted to all three colleges, and then I was able to pick at my leisure.\n<Character name>: Designed to handle menial daily tasks...cleaning, dressing, dining, etc., so the owner could focus on intellectual endeavors.\nZojja: Well, unless murder is a \"menial daily task,\" something's gone wrong. Your VAL-A golem went berserk and killed the people it was supposed to be serving.\nZojja: This is intolerable! You're the Snaff Prize Savant...Snaff, the master golemancer! Your failure dishonors his memory, and I can't have that.\n<Character name>: My golem wouldn't kill people. It couldn't! I made sure to—\nZojja: It could, and it has. If you want to live up to your title, Savant, you'd better head over to Desider Atum and sort this out. Fast.\nSpeaking with allies:\n\nKrewe Apprentice (1): Shh! Zojja's in a rare mood. I'm glad I'm not you, Savant!\n Uh-oh. That doesn't sound good.\nKrewe Apprentice (2): I tell you, I'd hate to be that Savant. Zojja's broken two arcanocams just thinking about it!\n She what? Hey, hang on, I'm the Savant.\nYou are? Oh jeez! I'd get out of Rata Sum, if I were you. I hear the charr lands are kinda pretty.\n I'll just talk to her. How bad can it be?\n Hm. I'd better go talk to her.\nKrewe Apprentice (3): Careful. Don't you have eyes? Zojja's watching!\n So? She's your boss, of course she's watching.\nYeah, but right now, she's so mad that she might twist my ears into gear-cogs!\n Whoa. Okay, I'll leave you be.\n Uh-oh. I'll go talk to her.\nMr. Sparkles: Maintenance protocols: engaged. Uploading patch.\n Maybe we'll talk when you're finished.\nZojja: All right, Savant. Go and check out that rampaging golem!\n Can you tell me more about what happened out there?\nA prototype of your VAL-A golem went crazy. If you don't find out what happened, it'll tarnish your legacy—and the title of Snaff Prize Savant.\n Right. I'm on it!\n I was kind of hoping we could chat a bit...\nI'm trying very hard to not throw things, <Character name>! Get out and get going!\n All righty!\n Off I go!\n\n\n=== At Desider Atum ===\nBefore attacking the VAL-A Golem:\n\nCitizen: (screaming)\nTrader: Look out!\nTrader: Tactical retreat!\nTechnician: Over there! Hurry!\nTrader: Retreat would be a good strategy right now.\nSpeaking with the asura:\n\nPeacemaker Officer: That...golem...ugh. It knocked me over! It's gone...berserk.\n Stay still. You have a concussion. I'll handle this.\nCitizen / Lab Attendant / Researcher: Please, do something before that crazy butler golem kills us all!\n Stay back! I'll handle this.\nDuring the battle with the VAL-A Golem:\n\nVAL-A Golem: Good-day. Allow—me—to—handle—all—your—household—needs.\nVAL-A Golem: Let—me—take—your—head—brzzt—hat.\nVAL-A Golem: Analyzing—room.\nVAL-A Golem: Shall—I—pop—the—cork?\nVAL-A Golem: Dust—located.\nVAL-A Golem: Polishing—the—liver—brzzt—silver!\nVAL-A Golem: Dusting—sequence—complete.\nVAL-A Golem: Dice, mince, puree!\nVAL-A Golem: Dinner—is—served.\nSpeaking with the asura after defeating the golem: \n\nCitizen (1): I can't believe you defeated it! That thing took down Peacemakers like—well, exactly like it was cleaning house!\n What happened? Why did it go haywire?\nOne moment it was pouring beer, doing chores, and the next moment—bam! Peacemakers down, and it was going berserk!\n Something's definitely not right here. Thanks for the information.\n Hold tight. Things'll be back to normal soon.\nCitizen (2) / Lab Attendant / Researcher / Trader: I need a moment. My heart's beating like crazy!\n Everything's going to be fine.\nPeacemaker Officer: Is it...deactivated?\n Yes. Don't worry, you'll feel better soon.\nInspecting the VAL-A Golem:\n\nVAL-A Golem: This VAL-A golem is based on your design, but it's been radically altered.\n This version of my golem is psychopathic. Not good. (this triggers the cinematic for Confer with Zojja)\n Investigate the golem to see what's been altered.\nThe control parameters are all wrong, and the logic arcanum is twisted beyond recognition.\n Anything else?\nYes. Instead of warm lager and fine wine, the VAL-A now serves only cold beer.\n I'd better do something about this!\n What? No! (this triggers a cinematic)\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\nZojja: Making progress, I see. Good. Listen, I've been thinking about what I said, and I...I came to apologize.\nZojja: When your golem ran wild, all I could think of was Snaff's legacy. I shouldn't have taken it out on you.\nZojja: You're a lot like him, actually: smart, capable, enthusiastic. Besides, it was your first golem. You were young, untested, and—\n<Character name>: And someone monkeyed with my designs. The golem I just trashed was so heavily modified, it's barely recognizable as my work.\n<Character name>: Misaligned aether couplings, altered control parameters...somebody took my idea and ran with it, right into a brick wall.\nZojja: If we can prove that, you'll be off the hook...and so will Snaff. All we need is a copy of your original designs from the archives.\n<Character name>: Then that's where I'm heading. I appreciate the apology, but you're right: this makes us all look bad. I'm going to find out who's responsible.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nZojja: Commence operations.\nSpeaking with allies:\n\nMr. Sparkles: Confirm: Abrogation—protocols—engaged. Recommend: Savant—proceed—with—investigation.\n Sounds like a plan.\nSpeaking with Zojja after the cinematic:\n\nZojja: Something's fishy. Golems don't just flip out for no reason. You're not that...er...untalented.\n Nice of you to say, Zojja.\nGet your head on straight, Savant, this isn't a sweetheart's party. The peacemakers are going to be furious about this mess.\n You're right. Can I ask you something? (same as \"Can I ask you something?\")\n So they are. We should go.\n Whoever did this is going to meet the short end of a dolyak prod when I catch 'em.\nKeep that anger ready. I have a feeling you're going to need it.\n Let me ask you something else. (same as \"Can I ask you something?\")\n I'll be ready.\n I'm sorry about all this. I won't let it dishonor the Snaff Prize.\nYou know the funny thing? I think he would have found this fascinating. He'd be worried, sure...but also intrigued.\n Let me ask you something. (same as \"Can I ask you something?\")\n He must have been an amazing mentor.\n Can I ask you something?\nHurry up, <Character name>. What is it?\n You mentioned that this model caused deaths elsewhere?\nThe first incident was at Mrot Boru. A few casualties. Peacemakers incinerated that golem before it could be examined.\n Let me ask you something else. (same as \"Can I ask you something?\")\n Ugh. Sounds like a mess. Thanks for telling me.\n How do I find out who had access to my patent blueprints?\nGo to Rata Sum's archives and meet Archivist Grep. He's fusty and musty, but he knows the archives like the back of his sonic parenthizer.\n Let me ask you something else. (same as \"Can I ask you something?\")\n I'm on it.\n Why would someone do this? A lot of people got hurt!\nBah. Only because they weren't quick enough to get away. Toughen up, Savant. You're smart, and you survive...or not.\n Let me ask you something else. (same as \"Can I ask you something?\")\n Right. I'll keep that in mind.\n Actually, never mind. Let's get started.\n We'll find the answer. I know it.\n\n\n== My story ==",

The floor is yours, Kudu. And make it good: we're busy people.\nKudu: I guarantee you'll be impressed, councillors. My Weather-matic 5000 will change the world...starting with yours.\nZojja: Stop! Kudu is setting you up. He's going to use that machine to flood Rata Sum permanently.\nKudu: Ah, Zojja. I trust the council is familiar with Snaff's former menial? And the Snaff Ser-vant—a menial's menial!\nKudu: So glad you got my invitation, dear. I was afraid something terrible had happened to you. No matter. Plenty of time for that later.\nKudu: I have to run now, councillors...it's a wee bit failure-heavy in here for my taste. Enjoy the show.\nAfter defeating the Inquest:\n\nZojja: I got this. Anything Kudu built, I can shut down. Leave it to me!\nCouncillor Flax: Not so fast, Zojja. The council can take care of itself. We need experience, not—\nZojja: Back off, Flax. I trained with Snaff, just like Kudu. So shut up and let me save us all.\nZojja: Putrescence! This thing's booby-trapped to summon elementals. Keep them off me while I work!\nWhen the first elementals appear:\n\nZojja: Prepare for battle!\nCutscene after destroying the transatmostpheric converter:\n\nZojja: So, a deluge in your chambers and a bevy of hostile elementals. Is the council ready to declare Kudu a threat, or do you need more proof?\nCouncillor Flax: The council is well aware of the animosity between you and Kudu. For all we know, you came to sabotage his demonstration.\nCouncillor Flax: I, for one, didn't see any elementals until after Zojja tampered with Kudu's device. This calls for a full subcommittee investigation.\n<Character name>: Which will take months to reach a conclusion, if it ever does. With respect, Councillor: you're a buffoon. If Zojja and I hadn't—\nZojja: Let it go, Savant. It's Rata Sum. The council's main duty is to preserve itself. These days, that means knuckling under to the Inquest.\nZojja: We stopped Kudu and destroyed the machine he stole from you. I'm going to count that as a win...but I'm getting increasingly tired of council politics.\nZojja: Keep yourself available. I've got a few irons in the fire, and I'll want you with me when they're ready to come out. I'll be in touch.\nSpeaking with Zojja:\n\nZojja: You did good, kid. The council owes you, and I guess I owe you, too.\n Does Kudu do this kind of thin often? Threaten Rata Sum?\nOnly on special occasions. Like every fifth Tuesday.\n I really hate that guy.\n What will the council do now?\nClean up, pass another prohibition against this kind of thing, and then go on. Standard fare.\n And Kudu?\nOh, I'll bet we haven't seen the end of him. One way or another, <Character name>, this isn't over.\n I look forward to it. Next time, he won't get away so easily. I promise you that.\n Thanks. That means a lot to me.\nSpeaking with the Arcane Council members:\n\nCouncillor Flax: I'm glad to see you. I thought we were done for!\n Wow, the Arcane Council chambers. What an honor to be here.\nThe honor is ours, <Character name>. Someday, perhaps one of these councillor's seats will be yours.\n We'll see.\n Am I right in assuming you're the leader of the council?\nFirst among equals—in name. In brain, I outclass them all, don't you know.\n Of course you do, sir. Of course you do.\n Everything'll be fine now.\nCouncillor Zudo: The weather changer was impressive! Er, I mean, if Kudu hadn't been trying to kill us with it...\n Of course it was impressive! It was originally my invention.\nWas it really? I don't know if I should congratulate you or arrest you.\n Either way, I'm flattered by the compliment. Thank you, Councillor.\n Attacking the finest minds of Rata Sum? This was a foolish plan.\nFoolish, but audacious. And an unexpected attack can be as effective as a well-planned one.\n Good point, Councillor.\nCouncillor Ludo: Really, Savant? You couldn't have stopped Kudu before he flooded the chambers? My outfit is ruined.\n What does the Arcane Council do?\nDo? We rule the city! We make laws, and approve patents—and apparently get rained on. Bah.\n Good to know. Oh and...sorry for the mess.\n I'm terribly sorry, Councillor. Feel free to send me the steamgolem bill.\nHmph. Well, at least you have manners. Carry on.\n Thank you, Councillor.\n Keep talking, and your face will be ruined.\nWhat? How dare you! You'll be scraping lab floors by the time I'm done with you!\n Yeah, yeah. Buzz off.\n My apologies, Councillor.\nPhlunt: Rain? Indoors? What the Hadron is going on in here! Why, in my day—\n It was Kudu, sir. He attacked the council with a weather machine.\nWho who? You sound like an owl, <Character name>. Stand up straight!\n Not who-who. Kudu. Snaff's first apprentice?\nMath? OF course I know math! What kind of things are they teaching you kids these days? Bah!\n Sigh. Have a good day, sir.\n Don't worry, Councillor, it's been handled.

It will begin attacking immediately, with the same skills it had in the previous fight, however it will most often use a ranged tossing attack that lands confusion on whoever it hits. This attack is very easy to evade and does not track. Once it's defeated, you'll have to leave the instance, and go to the arcane council for another fight.\nThe fight inside the arcane council takes place in 3 phases, though they are not separated by anything more than a small pause. The first wave of VAL-A golems is made up of eight miniature versions that only have a basic double-punch and spinning move. The second wave is six more of them. They all have much less health than their larger form. In the third phase, a VAL-PRIME will spawn. While having more health, his moves are actually less difficult to deal with than the original VAL-A. The PRIME can be looted after defeat for standard loot, and the councillors and Zojja can be spoken to.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nCitizen\nCouncillor Flax\nCouncillor Haia\nCouncillor Ludo\nCouncillor Zudo\nKrewe Apprentice\nKrewe Researcher\nPeacemaker Officer\nPhlunt\nZojja\nGolems\nMr. Sparkles\nPM-632z\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nGolems\nVAL-A Golem\nVAL-A PRIME\n\n\n== Objects ==\nBundles\nHammer\nMed Kit\nPower Matrix\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\n\n=== Snaff Memorial Lab ===\nZojja: If all Mink and Keppa are guilty of is idiocy, then the culprit has to be Haia.\nZojja: I've build this golem to Haia's specs.

Deactivating the golem may require force.\nZojja: Time to attack! I've got some aggression to work out.\nCinematic after the fight:\n\nZojja: Well, that settles that. The core that Haia swapped in must contain a hidden exploit to drive the golems to murder.\n<Character name>: So we're going up against a councillor? No mean task, but I'm ready. I don't care how high up she is, she can't do this to us.\n<Character name>: No sarcasm this time: Haia's not just smearing Snaff's reputation, or mine.

We know you're the one who turned the VAL-A golem into an anti-personnel device.\n<Character name>: We've got all the proof we need, and we're going to expose your machinations to the entire council.\nCouncillor Haia: Proof? You mean those blueprints I gave you, the ones my underlings are retrieving from your lab at this very moment?\nCouncillor Haia: You're not in my league, dearies. And after my modified VAL-As are finished with my fellow councillors...no one else will be, either.\nCouncillor Haia: You'll get the blame of course. Nothing personal: this is merely how top-level Council politics plays out. If it helps, I'd be happy to feign remorse.\nZojja: Let's go, Savant. If the council gets wiped out by your golems, the Peacemakers will fry us on sight. We'll have to catch up with Haia later.\nCouncillor Haia: Good luck, my darlings. Try not to die too painfully.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nZojja: We've got work to do! I just hope those oafs on the Council are grateful.\nSpeaking with Councillor Haia before she teleports away:\n\nCouncillor Haia: My, aren't you in a hurry. Whatever could the matter be?\n Save it. We're here to shut you down!\nSpeaking with your allies:\n\nZojja: Hurry up! We have to protect the Council.

What is the meaning of this?\n<Character name>: Those VAL-A golems were based on my designs. Councillor Haia tampered with them and sent them to kill as much of the council as possible.\nZojja: I can vouch for this. Haia is making a power play. We don't have hard evidence, but—\nCouncillor Flax: Say no more. Bold moves are Haia's style, and she never leaves evidence that can be traced back to her.\nCouncillor Flax: Leave Haia to us. We'll keep an eye on her. She may well receive a lethal gift of her own someday soon. In the meantime, you have our thanks.\nZojja: Well, it's not a complete victory, but we did save the Arcane Council...and Snaff's reputation. I'm sincerely sorry I ever doubted you.\n<Character name>: I accept your apology, again. Just remember: I'm the Snaff Savant. Sarcasm aside, you can count on me to live up to his example.\n<NPC> cheers for <Character name>.\nSpeaking with your allies after the fight:\n\nCouncillor Flax: Not a bad plan on Haia's part—except where you came in, Savant.\n That's a major understatement.\nCouncillor Ludo: Next time I'll bake Haia cookies—with bombs in them!\n Sounds delightful.\nCouncillor Zudo: Blasted Haia! When she thinks she's safe...that's when I'll strike! With stealth golems! Or poison mushrooms!\n Good luck with that.\nPhlunt: That Haia won't get the better of me today! Or any other day.\n You'll show her. One of these days.\nMr. Sparkles: Initiating—diagnostic—self-repairs. Update—1—of—345. Do—not—shut—off—or—unplug.\n Thanks for the help, Mr. Sparkles.\nZojja: Haia's powerful and wealthy, but even her resources are finite. She really made a run of this crazy mess, didn't she?\n She did. And I'm going to make a run of my fist in her face.\nAs much as I hate giving up a target, she'll probably get off with a slap on the wrist.\n Maybe next time, then.\n She'll get hers. I'm putting my money on another council member doing her in.\nThat might just happen. The councillors do a lot of back-and-forth sabotage. We'll have to wait and see.\n She'll get hers. Mark my words.\n Don't waste your time with Haia. You're better than her by far.\nI know! But...thanks for saying it. It's good to be appreciated from time to time.\n Anytime, Zojja.\n Someday, I tell you.

How did the Collider test go?\nShodd beckons to <Character name>.\nApproaching Shodd (cinematic):\n\nShodd: Welcome to the threshold of immortality! The lab is prepped and ready to go.\nShodd: The proving ground is entirely empty. No one to get hurt, no one to steal our glory.\n<Character name>: Sounds good. I'm eager to see what the Infinity Ball can do in a more controlled environment.\nShodd: Then you've come to the right place. We'll shake up the world, Zojja, the Arcane Council—everybody. Let's get started!\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nShodd: The area's clear, the Infinity Ball is primed. Let's see what we can see!\nTalking to Shodd:\n\nShodd: This will be both ground-breaking and mid-blowing. We've got the whole place to ourselves, and the only thing between us and success is time.\n I'm concerned about the Infinity Ball holding the charge the collider provided.\nNot to worry. The ball is at capacity, with no signs of energy loss. It's like us: you're the Infinity Ball, and I'm the energy surge that makes it magnificent.\n I like that description. When this is all over, you're ghost-writing my autobiography.\n Slow down, partner. We have to achieve magnificence before we can claim it.\n All right. Let's conduct this test.\n I certainly hope so.\nAfter activating the Infinity Ball and during fight (cinematic):\n\nShodd: It's working! A portal's opening! Come on, baby, show us the future!\nAfter the first portal opens:\n\nShodd: Look out, it's...tiny destroyers? Well, I'm not taking any chances. Get 'em!\nAs the second portal opens:\n\nShodd: Another portal's opening. Get ready!\nShodd: Flying destroyers? That's not even fair!\nA third and final portal:\n\nShodd: Glitch! Another portal!\nShodd: Oh, my ears. It's huge! Quick, stop that destroyer before it lives up to its name...on us!\nCinematic after the fight:\n\nShodd: There's no denying we got results. But if that's the future, I don't want to live there.\n<Character name>: It was A future, not THE future. In terms of quantum arcanics, we accessed other potentialities...but the connection was extremely unstable.\n<Character name>: The Infinity Ball needs more power. Otherwise, those portals will remain short-term doorways with no way to regulate outbound traffic.\nShodd: I agree. More power will anchor and strengthen the portals. But this test just drained all the energy we got from the Megahedron Collider.\n<Character name>: What we need is an entirely new power storage system, one that can store all the energy we need without requiring a recharge.\nShodd: An entirely achievable goal. Let me clean up here, and then I'll meet you at your lab to review the data and plan our next move.\nTalking to Shodd:\n\nShodd: Okay, we've got results. Now we just need to collate and analyze them. I'll collect the Infinity Ball and meet you back at your lab.\n Excellent. Soon the world will see just how brilliant we are.\n See you there.\n\n\n=== Applied Development Lab ===\nApproaching Zojja and Shodd:\n\nShodd: Before you start spitting fire, Zojja - calm down. We can explain everything.\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\nZojja: You did what? I told you once, the Infinity Ball is way too dangerous. And you two idiots have been toying with it?\nShodd: A-hem! Three idiots. You're working on the Infinity Ball, same as us. And the Savant has much better claim than you.\nZojja: My device predicts danger whereas yours creates it. This is your last warning: stop this, before you kill yourselves or others.\nShodd: Hmm. I thought she'd be angrier. Anyway, I can think of two potential power sources. The Inquest has one, Councillor Flax has the other.\n<Character name>: Come on, Shodd. Zojja's already furious. We can't antagonize the Inquest and the Arcane Council, too. I want this as much as you do, but Zojja—\nShodd: If you quit now, you'll both be disappointed. She doesn't want you to end up like her, stuck in her mentor's shadow her whole life.\n<Character name>: She's not necessarily stuck. Zojja's done great things on her own...but you're right about me. If I don't finish this, I'll always wonder. Let's talk power sources.\nTalking to Shodd:\n\nShodd: I know of two power sources that might make the Infinity Ball sing. The Inquest has one; Councillor Flax has the other.\n The Inquest isn't known for sharing. What do they have for us, and how do we get it?\nTheir Invariant base competes directly with the Megahedron Collider in energy research. We just appropriate one of their prototype power cells, which they're bound to have and definitely won't miss.\n So it's a two-fer, eh? Our benefit to the Inquest's detriment. Let's do it.\n That's one option. What about Councillor Flax?\n Give me a moment to ponder this.\n Monkey with the head of the Arcane Council? What's he got that's worth such a risk?\nFlax carries a viable power source with him. You know that fancy walking stick he carries? The jewel on the end of that crozier is a high-output power cell that would be perfect for our needs.\n True, the council always gets the best gear. Okay, let's \"acquire\" Flax's crozier.\n What about the Inquest? What have they got for us?\n I'd like a moment to think this over.\n I'm not ready to decide yet.\nTalking to your allies after making a decision:\n\nZojja: I've said my piece. Shodd's a dangerous fool, and if you listen to him you're a bigger one. The Infinity Ball is too dangerous to be tinkered with. You need a plan and reliable backup.\n You can relax. I'm the Snaff Savant, remember? I don't make mistakes.\n I'm glad you're working on it, too. The Infinity Ball couldn't be in better hands.\n I see your point. I'll make sure to have both those things if and when I proceed.\n Noted. Thanks for your input.\nMr. Sparkles: I—must—put—some—distance—between—you—and—me—until—Zojja—regains—equilibrium. Until—then: don't—drag—Mr.—Sparkles—into—your—nightmare.\n Very well. I think she's overreacting, but I also can't blame you for playing it safe.\n Don't worry. Zojja will change her tune after she sees the full scope of my success.\n I'll do my best not to.\nShodd: Don't let Zojja intimidate you. She just wants to see if you've got what it takes to rise to this challenge. Remember: the timid let themselves get sidelined, leaving glory to the bold.\n I think there's more to it than that, but I'm also not ready to abandon my invention.\nNor should you! Once we acquire the power source we need, the Infinity Ball will change everything...for you, for me, for Zojja...for the entire world.\n Sounds good. I can see our future now: Shood and <Character Name>, geniuses at large.\n I hope so. I'd hate to make Zojja this mad and have nothing to show for it.\n I'm definitely looking forward to that.\n\n\n== My story ==",

I was messing around in my lab...I mean, conducting open-ended research...and I ran across your Infinity Ball.\n<Character name>: Ah yes, my first invention ever. Still proud of it. Designed to show you a glimpse of the future...well, a potential future, anyway.\n<Character name>: It functioned well enough to earn a spot in the archives, but it wasn't as reliable as I'd hoped. The feasibility stabilizer was...unpredictable.\nZojja: Still, I like it. What would you say if I told you I could repurpose it into something useful?\n<Character name>: Take your best shot. I'd love to see your modifications. And thanks for the heads-up. As always, you professional courtesy is impeccable.\nShodd: Excuse me, Zojja? You've talked so highly of the Snaff Savant, I couldn't pass up this chance for an introduction.\nZojja: Of course. Shodd, meet the Snaff Savant. Savant, meet Shodd. He's trouble, so don't let him drag you down to his level. You two play nice, now. I've got work to do.\nTalking to Shodd:\n\nShodd: Don't get me wrong, Zojja's a genius and all, but she's too cautious. You can follow her lead, but don't let her timidity and trepidation prevent you from achieving your dreams.\n Zojja? Timid? That's crazy talk. Zojja's opinion is one of the most valuable in Rata Sum.\nDoesn't mean she's always right. Your invention is a winner-or it could be, with just a little more work. Why let her do it? Any accolades from the Infinity Ball should be yours.\n What accolades? The Infinity Ball doesn't even work, remember?\nIt DIDN'T work. That's my point. Maybe Zojja can make it work, but so can you. Especially if I help. You just need to stop thinking like a krewe menial and start thinking like a genius. Take charge!\n I would like to finish what I started. Okay, I'm listening. What did you have in mind?\nI've conducted a cursory review of your designs, and I think the problem is all in the power input-to-output ratio. What you need is a high-yield power supply.\n Yes, that would make a difference. But where do we find one that'll work?\nHead over to the Luminates Plant. I know the krewe chief on their Megahedron Collider project. I'll send word ahead and set up a trial. Tell him I sent you, and you'll have full run of the place.\n The Megahedron—of course! Okay, Shodd, you're on. I'll meet you at the Luminates Plant.\nTalking with allies:\n\nShodd: We are destined for greatness. Combining our collective genius and drive is a recipe for success of unimaginable proportions!\n No argument here. We are the perfect combination of brains and ambition.\n A sound theory. Let's test it and the Infinity Ball simultaneously!\nZojja: Can't wait to show you my take on the Infinity Ball. It'll be like we're collaborating—across time! Which I actually prefer, as it limits the amount of interaction with other people I have to endure.\n Any level of collaboration with you is a worthwhile endeavor.\n I'll leave you to it, then. Good luck. And thanks.\nMr. Sparkles: Zojja—has—all—the—information—you—require. My—role—here—is—threefold: 1) observe, 2) assist—Zojja—as—necessary, 3) look—sleek—and—intimidating.\n You're definitely doing your job, then.\n\n\n=== At the Luminates Plant ===\nUpon entering the Luminates Plant:\n\nHead Protestor: Stop the madness! If you activate this thing, it could end all life as we know it.\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Are you really this naive? Or did some other krewe put you up to this?\nHead Protestor: We won't let you get away with this! We will not let you murder Mother Tyria!\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Mother Tyria's not in danger...but you will be, if you don't let me get back to work.\nProtestor speech bubbles:\n\nProtestor: Only you can prevent the Megahedron Collider!\nProtestor: Please, take a moment and think of our offspring!\nProtestor: Ethics first! Science second!\nProtestor: Ethics first, and then pudding!\nProtestor: Invention, not destruction!\nProtestor: The Megahedron Collider will kill us all! Shut it down!\nProtestor: Stop the madness! Hey hey, ho ho, the Megahedron Collider has got to go!\nProtestor: Support ethical science! Practice ethical magic!\nTalking to the Head Protestor:\n\nHead Protestor: You there! Join us! Now's the time to stand up for responsible magical resource management. Don't let the Megahedron Collider poison Mother Tyria!\n I'm busy. Pipe down and get out of my way, goofball.\n Your nuanced argument has totally convinced me. Excuse me while I go plant a tree.\n I respect your position, but you have to move past slogans and present real alternatives.\n Excuse me, I have work to do.\nCinematic with Luminates Supervisor Wenn:\n\n<Character name>: Are you in charge? I'm here to apply the Megahedron Collider to an invention of mine. Shodd sent me.\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: You picked a bad time, but I owe Shodd a favor. I had to pull a few strings, but the collider is all yours. Hope you don't mind a little noise.\n<Character name>: Yeah, I saw the protestors. They looked upset. Why are they picketing you?\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: They hate me. We blew this place up too many times already, and now they fear that if we turn the Collider on, it'll start a chain reaction and end all life on Tyria.\n<Character name>: Uhh...will it?\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Doubtful. It hasn't so far. But hey, maybe today's the day. Most of my krewe took a day off, and the protestors want a disaster. Let's roll the dice!\nTalking to Wenn:\n\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Between the protestors and my krewe all being out sick, I've got my hands full.\n Don't worry about me. I won't get in your way.\nAfter placing the Infinity Ball in the Megahedron Collider:\n\n(A strange blue portal appears, and the Head Protestor is sucked into it.)\nHead Protestor: You were warned, but you didn't listen! Now we're all gonna d—\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Heh. One less dirt-hugger. And don't look so nervous, I can handle this.\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Uh-oh. Something's coming through the portal, and it doesn't seem happy.\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Tell you what: you kill whatever sticks its head out while I shut down the portal.\nShodd: Well, I can't say that was completely unexpected. No worries. I'm here to help.\nTalking to Shodd as he arrives during the battle:\n\nShodd: Nobody knows just how the Megahedron Collider and your Infinity Ball will interact... but we're about to find out.\n You got that right, partner.\nAfter the fight:\n\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Whoa! For a second there, I thought that might have been the big one. Good-bye cruel world.\nShodd: Did you see those things that came out of the portal? Machines like that just don't exist.\nShodd: Anyway, thanks for your help. Now I owe you one. Keep up the good work!\nCinematic with Shodd upon retrieving the Infinity Ball:\n\nShodd: That was unbelievable, unprecedented! We made history and saw the future, all at once.\n<Character name>: Empirically, it shows an alternate version of reality, not the future. And based on those mechanical monstrosities, a reality we're better off without.\nShodd: Details, details. You should be excited! The collider supercharged your Infinity Ball. Now it works on an entirely different level.\n<Character name>: We need to test this somewhere remote, far from Rata Sum, with all its spying ears and innocent bystanders.\nShodd: I have an old lab I don't use anymore. It would be perfect. You have to do this, Savant. Greatness is within your grasp.\n<Character name>: I do want to see this through...and if no one else gets hurt... All right. I'll meet you there and we'll run more tests.\nTalking to allies again:\n\nLuminates Supervisor Wenn: Thanks for your help. I'll be filling out the incident report paperwork all day, but it's worth it for even a short respite from all that sanctimonious chanting.\n The protestors have valid concerns about this facility.\n Glad you think so. See you around.\nShodd: I'd call that a hugely successful first effort. We've taken the Infinity Ball into exciting new territory. The path to worldwide acclaim stands open before us!\n Then we must press on. Together, we could revolutionize life as we know it.\n Couldn't have done it without you.\n Excellent. Let's continue.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe name of this quest likely comes from Arthur C. Clarke's third \"law\" of prediction: \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"\nThe Megahedron Collider, and the fact protestors are worried that if turned on it will end all life on Tyria, is likely a reference to the Large Hadron Collider and the fear the public had that it might create microscopic black holes.",

Well, this is the right time and place, but...Let's say I've got good news and bad news.\n What's the good news?\nFlax isn't here, and his crozier is. The bad news is, he left Filka in charge. She's the Morphologists krewe's second-in command. Meaner than a blood-drunk charr and twice as brutal.\n Sounds like just another Inquest bully. I know how to handle her.\n What do we know about Flax's krewe?\nThe Morphologists? Mostly toadies and suck-ups that feed Flax's ego—and he still treats them like dirt. It's a thankless job, but there are some tough customers and a few hard workers in the mix.\n Good to know. I think I can handle Filka.\nDo you, now? All right, let's hear the Savant's master plan.\n I'll give her a taste of my \"adoring fan\" routine. Bullies love flattery. (same as ferocity response below)\n Bullies always cave to bigger bullies. I'll pretend I outrank her and bluster my way in. (same as ferocity response below)\n Make them panic. I'll present a dire impending threat- authoritatively- and they'll comply.\nBut how do we get the crozier once we're past Filka? We need a distraction. Hey, I know! Energy facilities attract elementals. Maybe we could lure some in.\n Perfect. Let me make a few on-the-fly adjustments to the machines, and we're in business.\nYeah! They'll be so busy fighting, no one will even notice us. And if they do, we just pitch in to help. They'll be so grateful, they'll give us anything we want.\n Exactly. Let's put this plan in motion.\n Let's hear the bad news.\nThe crozier's here, but Flax's krewe chief, Filka, is on duty. Her expression alone sends river drakes running for cover—and that's when she's in a good mood. Right now, she's in a real bad mood.\n No problem. I know how to deal with Inquest bullies. (same as \"Good to know. I think I can handle Filka.\")\n What do we know about Flax's krewe? (same as above)\n I'm not ready for news yet. Give me a moment to get situated.\nTalking to Shodd again:\n\nShodd: We're so close. Keep your eyes on the prize, and Flax's crozier is ours for the taking.\n You should write all those inspirational cliches down. And stop saying them out loud.\n Shh. I'm preparing my patter.\nCinematic with Filka if you chose charm with Shodd:\n\n<Character name>: Excuse me, is this the actual lab of the famous Morphologists Krewe?\nFilka: Why, yes, it is. We don't have any opening at the moment but if you leave your credentials—\n<Character name>: Oh it's not that, it's just I...I've looked up to the Morphies my entire life. I know I'm not worthy to join such an illustrious gang of geniuses.\n<Character name>: I'm about to begin an exciting new chapter of my career and I wanted to bask in your light... you know, for inspiration.\n<Character name>: If it's not too much trouble, could you give me a quick tour? I promise I won't take too much of your time.\nFilka: Well, it's highly irregular... but Councilor Flax does encourage interaction with the less gifted in our community. Follow me.\nFollowing Filka during the tour:\n\nFilka: Stay close and pay attention. I rarely give this tour, and I do not repeat myself.\nFilka: Here we have the central lab. Every holomagical reading is routed to these consoles for analysis.\nFilka: You are now viewing our power crystals, which are derived from elementals. It's a fantastic source of energy that I perfected, thank you.\nFilka: Tricky to contain elementals? For the layman, yes. But for a genius like me, it's all in a day's work.\nFilka: Oh, this must be exciting for you. Take a moment to study our brilliance[sic] Perhaps some of it will sink in, hmm?\nCinematic with Filka if you chose dignity with Shodd:\n\n<Character name>: Make way! This is a surprise inspection! The Arcane Eye hereby commandeers this facility until further notice. Who's in charge here?\nFilka: I am. And you are?\n<Character name>: I'm the one who's going to shut down this place if I don't get some cooperation. I want to see this facility run a full diagnostic scan. What's your name?\nFilka: Krewe Chief Filka, thank you very much. And before you take another step, I need to see some credentials.\n<Character name>: You don't have the clearance to see my credentials, much less demand them. Now stand aside or I'll see you cataloging fish eggs in Loch Jezt.\nFilka: I...very well. But I'll be filing an official protest with the Arcane Council. Morphologists krewe! To your stations! The Arcane Eye needs to see us in action.\nCinematic with Filka if you chose ferocity with Shodd:\n\n<Character name>: You're all in terrible danger! Those maniacs at the College of Synergetics overloaded an entire tripolar disruption accelerator array.\nFilka: Excuse me! Who are you, and what are you on about?\n<Character name>: Elementals. Hundreds of them. You're about to be ears-deep in rampaging energy monsters.\n<Character name>: The phase resonance modulators here will draw them straight to this facility. I've got to recalibrate your equipment, or you're all dead.\n<Character name>: I'm only going to say this once: if you want to stay alive and uncremated, take cover and stay put until I say otherwise.\nInteracting with the consoles:\n\nConsole: The ancient monitor is a model notoriously riddled with security flaws.\n Realign the elemental capacitor's thaumic fuses.\nConsole: The monitor displays a formula for the system's central elemental harmonic resonator algorithm.\n Tweak the formula, and restart the algorithmic sequencer.\nConsole: The system's quantum data flow appears on this monitor as a circular packet of information oscillating between two vertical bar-shaped icons representing input and output.\n Adjust the input icon onscreen to redirect the incoming data packet.\nThe circular data packet rebounds at a 67.5 degree angle.\n Adjust the output icon onscreen so that the data packet completely misses it.\nSystem Error (Code P0-N6). Shutdown protocol 7-0 now active. Slaughter rule is in effect. Aetheric hologram interface must be manually recalibrated to continue.\n Cross the circuits to bypass the security protocol.\nAfter interacting with the three consoles:\n\nFilka: Elementals! What? I mean... how? I mean... stop them before they destroy the lab!\nAfter the fight if you chose charm with Shodd:\n\nFilka: You saved us! We still don't have any openings but rest assured if you submit your curriculum vitae, it'll go straight to the top of the pile.\n<Character name>: Thanks so much! I'm just glad I was here. If anything happened to the Magnificent Morphies, I'd never forgive myself.\n<Character name>: There is one thing you could do for me, though. Earlier, I saw the staff Councilor Flax carries. You know the one?\nFilka: His crozier? Yes he leaves it with us whenever he's not using it.\nFilka: In fact, I was just about to deliver it to him at the council chamber. If you take it for me, it might be your chance to get noticed. Interested?\n<Character name>: Absolutely! No one can pull strings like a council member, I'll take the crozier to him right away. Thanks!\nAfter the fight if you chose dignity with Shodd:\n\n<Character name>: Well, there's your problem. See that staff? It's emitting an unstable transenergetic signature. That's what caused the elemental outbreak.\nFilka: But that's Councillor Flax's crozier. He carries it with him whenever he's got important Council business.\n<Character name>: Then we're all very lucky he didn't have it with him today. I'm going to have to confiscate this crozier for the time being.\n<Character name>: The Arcane Eye will conduct an extensive battery of tests. In the mean time, you should put this place through a comprehensive diagnostic screening.\n<Character name>: And pray the problem is with this crozier, and not your facility. Otherwise, I'll be back. And I won't be so friendly.\nFilka: That won't be necessary. I'll take this whole lab apart and personally inspect every last crystal resonance diode. Thanks again.\nAfter the fight if you chose ferocity with Shodd:\n\nFilka: That was...well, words elude me about what just transpired, but it appears we owe you our lives. Thank you.\n<Character name>: No need to thank me. But if you want to do yourselves a favor, don't mention I was here.\n<Character name>: Not unless you want Arcane Eye agents poking and prodding every thaumic coupling and magical circuit in the place.\n<Character name>: In the meantime, I need to collect Councillor Flax's crozier. It's the source of the disturbance, so it can't stay here. I'll see that Flax gets it.\n<Character name>: And make sure you check your phase resonance modulators twice daily from now on. You never know when there'll be another...incident.\nFilka: We will. Thanks again. If the Eternal Alchemy rewards good deeds, you're in for some serious remuneration.\nSpeaking with Shodd on your way out:\n\nShodd: We did it! Right out from under their noses, too. Morphologist Krewe—hah! Infinity Ball, here we come!\n And when Zojja sees it, I expect equal measures of praise and jealously[sic] from her.\n Agreed. Let's wrap this up and make a clean getaway.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nBig Stick Ideology refers to President Theodore Roosevelt's military policy, \"speak softly, and carry a big stick.\"",

Intriguing stuff.\nZojja waves at <Character name>.\nZojja: Good, you got my letter. Gorr's just about to start his presentation. This should be interesting.\nEmcee: Now, let's welcome Professor Gorr.\nProfessor Gorr: The Seventh Law of Maginamics posits that magical energy cannot be destroyed. Today I will prove that magic is a limited resource like water, ore, or timber.\nProfessor Gorr: Using my advanced equipment, I have detected significant drops in the world's ambient magic levels. This drop, I believe, is directly attributed to the return of the Elder Dragons.\nProfessor Gorr: They consume magic at an alarming rate. If the dragons are not stopped soon, they will leech all of the magic from the world.\nCitizen: Ah, bosh! Magic doesn't get \"consumed.\" It changes form and concentration, but it always returns. It's part of a closed system.\nProfessor Gorr: I have proof! The data is...where did I leave those notes? I must have left them in my lab.\nCitizen: Boo! Boooooooo!\nCitizen: This is pure bunk! Get off the stage!\nProfessor Gorr: Please excuse me while I fetch my records. I can prove the problem exists, then we can focus on its solution.\nEmcee: Professor Gorr will return shortly. Until then, please welcome Cepha from the Phrenologist Krewe.\nZojja: Thank you for coming. I see a lot of overlap in Gorr's theory and our shared goals.\nScholar Krasso: As do I. If Gorr's research aligns with the Priory's, we may be looking at a cultural revolution.\nCrusader Slep: Revolutions are won militarily, not academically. Still, Gorr's theory could prove useful.\nAgent Batanga: I agree, but nothing can happen until Gorr makes his case. Why don't we all settle in and listen?\nTalking to the Order Representatives:\n\nAgent Batanga: If you've got questions about the Order of Whispers, I've got all the answers. I can only give you some of them, however. And they may be in code.\n I do have some questions.\nI'll try to answer as directly as possible, but no promises. I've been training to be evasive for so long it's become second nature.\n What is the Order of Whispers?\nWe're problem-solvers. We work behind the scenes and in the shadows. We're not soldiers—we're spies, saboteurs, and assassins. Our current top problems is the Elder Dragons.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n How does the Order of Whispers operate?\nAs the name indicates: quietly. We eschew direct confrontation in favor of subtlety and guile. If we can avoid a war by blackmailing a general or poisoning a potentate, that's what we do.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n How was the Order founded?\nThat's hard to say...to you. Until you officially join, let's just go with, \"We came from somewhere else for the purpose of protecting innocents from dark magic and would-be conquerors.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n That's all I needed to know.\n I'll check in with you later.\nScholar Krasso: If you're interested in the Durmand Priory, I'd be happy to answer any questions. Let's keep it down, though. I don't want to spoil the other geniuses' presentations.\n I do have a few questions.\nConsider me your personal font of esoteric knowledge. Ask away.\n What is the Priory?\nWe're an academy of researchers and explorers that finds, archives, and employs ancient wisdom. Our current focus is the defeat of the Elder Dragons, and we're pursuing multiple means to that end.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n How does the Priory operate? What are your methods?\nWe employ academics, explorers, and combatants at facilities all across Tyria. We go where antiquities are, collect them, study them, and put them to use.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n Who founded the Priory?\nDurmand, of course. He was a scholar in Lion's Arch when Orr rose. His cliff-top monastery became a repository for knowledge that would have otherwise been lost in the chaos following the flood.\n So other scholars came to him?\nScholars and mages of all races came to do research and share what they knew. Durmand quickly saw this as a way to combat the dragons. Knowledge is often literally power, after all.\n I see.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n That's all I needed to know.\n Not right now, thanks.\nCrusader Slep: Standing by if you have any questions about the Vigil.\n I do have a few questions.\nFire when ready.\n What is the Vigil?\nThe Vigil is a highly trained, well-disciplined army dedicated to destroying the Elder Dragons through open warfare. We also protect civilians and repair the damage the dragons do.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n How does the Vigil operate?\nLike a well-oiled military machine. We do reconnaissance, we identify objectives, and we strike. Our actions are always tightly coordinated and focused on getting results.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n Who founded the Vigil?\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper. The Crystal Dragon killed her warband when it created the Brand. She dedicated her life to building a fighting force that could respond to that level of devastation.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n That's all I needed to know.\n None right now, thanks.\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\nZojja: Savant, allow me to present three of Rata Sum's finest minds: Slep of the Vigil, Batanga of the Order of Whispers, and Krasso of the Durmand Priory.\nZojja: I asked them here to listen to Professor Gorr's speech, because they all have an interest in fighting the Elder Dragons.\nScholar Krasso: Pleased to meet you, Savant. The Durmand Priory is dedicated to research and exploration that will help us combat the Elder Dragons.\nScholar Krasso: As you can imagine, we've been watching Professor Gorr's progress with keen interest. I'm glad to see you share that interest.\nAgent Batanga: We all share the Priory's interest...just not their methods. In the Order of Whispers, we specialize in covert activity: information, infiltration, and assassination.\nAgent Batanga: I understand, you're more of a doer than a researcher, so you'll appreciate this: if Gorr's theory gives us a clear avenue of attack, we intend to use it.\nCrusader Slep: How clear does a target have to be for you sneaks? The dragons aren't exactly tiny, nor do they keep a low profile.\nCrusader Slep: The Vigil's army of dedicated fighters was founded to confront the dragons through force of arms. I'm here to see if Gorr's work can help us do that.\n<Character name>: Pleased to meet you all. Professor Gorr's theory is ground-breaking...and the implications are monumental. I'm interested to hear him finish his presentation.\nZojja: He should be back soon. Let's see if any of the other speakers have any insights for us while we wait.\nWaiting for Gorr to return:\n\nCepha: An exhaustive study of Tyrian physiognomy led me to derive what I call Cepha's Constant.\nCepha: Multiplied by the mean ratio of body mass to brain size, it yields an important racial metric.\nCepha: Namely, said race's importance as a factor in the Eternal Alchemy.\nCepha: Asura scored highest, naturally. Then, in descending order, we have sylvari, charr, human, and norn.\nEmcee: Your attention, please. I have just been informed that our colleague Gorr will not be returning.\nEmcee: The Arcane Eye reports that he was killed in a tragic lab accident while recovering his notes.\nEmcee: It is a terrible blow to science. We should all mourn one of Rata Sum's finest minds.\nEmcee: On that dolorous note, this seminar is hereby concluded. Thank you for coming.\nCinematic with the Order Representatives:\n\nZojja: Gorr died just as he was about to present proof of his theory. Does that strike anyone else as suspicious? Even dubious?\n<Character name>: It does. I'd like to inspect Gorr's lab and review his documentation. Though if the Arcane Eye's involved, we may not get that chance.\nAgent Batanga: The Order of Whispers can help. The Arcane Eye serves the Arcane Council, right? They have to do what the Council says. It's in their charter.\nAgent Batanga: We simply pay a visit to High Councillor Flax's lab, find the materials to make a convincing forgery, and walk right past the Arcane Eye.\nScholar Krasso: How unnecessarily complicated. Simpler just to outwit the sentries outside Gorr's lab. The Arcane Eye can't match the Priory's brain power.\nCrusader Slep: I'll leave fact-finding to the Priory and Whispers. When you lot establish a clear objective, the Vigil will be ready.\nZojja: Listen, Savant. I'm pursuing a long-term, big-picture strategy here, so I want you to take charge. Choose the most viable plan and see it through.\nZojja: We need to know what Gorr was going to show us. And if he was silenced, we need to know who did it, and why. Good luck.\nTalking to NPCs before choosing your course of action:\n\nAgent Batanga: Are you up for some intrigue, Whispers-style? Access Flax's office, forge the documents we need, and breeze past the Arcane Eye sentries into Gorr's lab. What do you say?\n I say count me in.\n I need more time to decide.\nScholar Krasso: The Priory plans to outsmart the Arcane Eye and access Gorr's lab. Their security detail must have a flaw, and we're the ones to identify and exploit it. Are you with me?\n Yes. Let's get started.\n I need more time to decide.\nCrusader Slep: I'd love to have an iron in this fire, but the Vigil only commits resources when there's a clear combat objective. Good luck getting into Gorr's lab.\n Thanks.\nIf you chose to go with the Order of Whispers:\n\nAgent Batanga: Excellent choice. You're on your way to getting results. See you outside Councillor Flax's lab.\nAgent Batanga: I knew you were Whispers material. I saw that gleam in your eye when I mentioned forgery. Meet me at Councillor Flax's office, and we'll put you to work.\n See you there.\nScholar Krasso: Hmm. I thought Snaff Savants were supposed to be reasonable and perceptive. Ah, well. One outing with the Order of Whispers should show you the limitations of their approach. Good luck.\n Thanks.\nIf you chose to go with the Durmand Priory:\n\nScholar Krasso: You've chosen wisely. I'll meet you outside Gorr's lab.\nAgent Batanga: So, you're going with the Priory, eh? That's okay. Geniuses-in-training tend to gravitate toward academic options. When you're ready for real results, we'll still be here.\n Thanks.\nScholar Krasso: So glad to have you with us for this outing. I hope this will be the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration. I'll meet you at Gorr's lab.\n See you there.\n\n\n== My story ==",

There's no dearth of lab assistants to accost, but they're only doing their jobs.\n<Character name>: Do we really have to render one of them unconscious just to improve my sartorial splendor?\nAgent Batanga: I'll chalk that up to compassion rather than squeamishness...but no, we don't have to.

If we understand what they want, what they eat, we can use that against them.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n Why is this important? How big a threat are the Elder Dragons?\nThe biggest. Ever notice how recorded history only goes back so far? That's because Tyria had to start over after the last time the dragons rose. They wiped out nearly everything and everyone.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n I'm ready. Let's get to infiltrating.\n I'm ready now. Let's go.\nTalking to the Disgruntled Apprentice:\n\nDisgruntled Apprentice: I'm doing it! Can't you lay off for even a second? How can I get my work done if I'm defending myself from you all the time?\n Relax. It's clear you're overworked, so I'm here to relieve you.\nHow can you relieve me if you're not even on the staff here? Filka will take one look at you and start kicking until everybody's dead.\n Give me your uniform. I may not be as pretty as you, but I can fake it.\nSo Filka can trace this back to me? Nothing doing. Here, takes this spare outfit. Put it on, and keep your head down. I'm going to catch a nap in the heat exchangers. It's safer in there.\n Thanks.\n I offered to start my shift early and cover for you. If you don't want that...\nI do, but I just don't want to...oh, glitch it. Here. Take this spare uniform. I'm going to take an extended break and look for a new job.\n Good luck with that. Leave everything else to me.\n You're tired and cranky, and that makes you sloppy. Give me your uniform and clear out before I tell Filka how close you are to fouling up this whole operation.\nDon't do that! Here, take this spare. I'm gone. And if we're lucky, Filka will never notice you're not me. But if she does, it's your problem.\n I can handle it.\n Sorry to bother you.\n I'll come back when you're calmer.\nTalking to NPCs once inside the lab:\n\nAgent Batanga: The Order of Whispers is all about misdirection. A distraction here, a bit of commotion over there, and no one's looking at us. Ready to shake things up?\n So we don't have to worry about a fair fight or honorable combat?\nHeh. You're funny. Let me put it this way: if I was engaging a guy in single combat at dawn, I'd hamstring him and glue his sword in the scabbard the night before.\nI think I get it now. Thanks.\n I'm ready.\nFilka: Why are you talking to me? There's work to do. Get back to your post, or I'll knot your ears together and hang you from the ceiling like a decorative lamp.\n Right away, chief.\nWhile creating a distraction:\n\nFilka: Work, you feebs, or I'll toss you all into a pot and make a huge batch of simp stew.\nAgent Batanga: That's Flax's lab manager. A real pushover, right?\nFilka: You there! Did you forget what my boot feels like on your neck? Because I can remind you!\nAgent Batanga: Yep, a real pushover.

One more thump and she'll shatter.\n(tamper with the experimental console)\nKrewe Researcher: Uh, chief? I think we have a serious problem here.\nFilka: That does it. Step aside, troglodytes! I'll handle this myself.\nAgent Batanga: Filka's on the move. Now's our chance!\nCinematic after forging the paperwork:\n\nAgent Batanga: Nicely done, Savant. So far, you've displayed a genuine knack for this sort of work.\n<Character name>: Thanks, but this was the easy part. Sneaking past the Arcane Eye will be dangerous.\nAgent Batanga: Not with this most excellent forgery. I'm eager to test our methods against those of the Arcane Eye. Secret society versus secret police: who comes out on top?\n<Character name>: We're about to find out. Meet me at Gorr's lab and let's see if our little ersatz authorization passes muster.\nSpeaking to Batanga in Flax's office:\n\nAgent Batanga: See? That's how we do it. Flax's lab is in chaos, Filka's on the verge of a rage-induced seizure, and no one will even notice the materials we stole. Total success.\n You're a little too happy about Filka's pain.\nI just don't like bullies—but I do like making them look foolish. Nothing beats toppling someone who likes pushing other people around and not giving them a chance to push back.\n I like your style.\n I have to agree: so far, so good.\n\n\n=== At Advanced Metamystics Lab ===\nApproaching Batanga:\n\nAgent Batanga: There's Rakt from the Arcane Eye. We'll need to get by him to get in—and he's good.\nTalking to Batanga:\n\nAgent Batanga: Look at these Arcane Eye goons. I've seen plenty of crime scene investigations, and I'm telling you: this one screams \"cover up.\"\n Tell me what you know about the Arcane Eye.\nThey're the Arcane Council's secret police. Ruthless, efficient, and backed by the highest possible authority. Generally, they do whatever dirty work is required to keep the council[sic] in power.\n They won't stop us.\n Let's get in there and see what they're hiding.\nCinematic with Rakt:\n\n<Character name>: Stand aside. The Arcane Council sent us to survey this situation. They're waiting on our report.\nRakt: You're out of your league. The Arcane Eye is handling this for the Council.\n<Character name>: Not anymore. See this? Signed by High Councillor Flax himself.\nRakt: Glitch. This is just typical. Those bureaucrats distrust everything unless they can micromanage it.\nRakt: Your presence here is redundant and unnecessary, but you have authorization, so you can go in. Just know that I'll be watching you.\nTalking to Rakt after cinematic:\n\nRakt: Papers or no papers, I don't want you hanging around. This is an official Arcane Eye investigation. Whatever your business is here, conclude it and get out.\n We'll be gone before you know it.\nWhile searching the lab:\n\nAgent Batanga: So far, so good. Now to see what they're hiding.\nCinematic after investigating the body:\n\n<Character name>: Hold everything. This isn't Gorr's body, is it?\nAgent Batanga: It sure isn't. Which means Gorr's oh-so convenient death is merely a ruse. But whose ruse? We need more clues.\n<Character name>: Keep that up and I'll give you a bruise, lose...er.\nRakt: Stop right there. You idiots have seen enough. You are interfering with an official Arcane Eye investigation.\nRakt: Move along. Now, before I have to send for more body bags.\n<Character name>: Time to go. But we're on to something. Let's regroup with the other orders. I want to hear what they and Zojja make of this.\nAfter cinematic:\n\nAgent Batanga: My keen sense of smell detects something fishy here. Let's check in with Zojja.\nSpeaking with NPCs:\n\nAgent Batanga: I knew Rakt and his thugs were hiding something. Buf if Gorr's body isn't here, where is it? And is it still alive and kicking?\n I don't know, but I aim to find out.\nRakt: If I see you around here again, I'll make you disappear...and a team of bloodhounds with a map and a karmic resonance tracker won't be able to find your body. Understand?\n Better than you think.\n\n\n=== At Applied Development Lab ===\nUpon approaching the order representatives:\n\nCrusader Slep: So Gorr's \"death\" was a fraud. How does knowing that help us? The problem is still Elder Dragons.\nCrusader Slep: While you poke around in back alleys or libraries for information, the Vigil is out there fighting.\nAgent Batanga: And while you're fighting, Whispers is setting up the means to deliver a death blow.\nAgent Batanga: We appreciate the distraction you provide, but you don't really think you're going to overpower an Elder Dragon, do you?\nScholar Krasso: Swords alone won't get results. Neither will intrigue. The Priory supports a more holistic approach.\nScholar Krasso: We intend to learn all we can about the dragons and their weaknesses before we strike.\nCinematic with the Order Representatives:\n\n<Character name>: Rakt's Arcane Eye agents were all over Gorr's lab. They removed a body they claimed was Gorr, but it wasn't. I suspect he's still alive.\nZojja: If he is, the Arcane Eye has him. They run a remote facility in a human village called Garenhoff. It's isolated, remote...a perfect place to stash Gorr.\nCrusader Slep: Finally, a concrete objective. Just say the word and I'll have Vigil soldiers standing by to storm Garenhoff.\nAgent Batanga: No, Rakt is too good at this game for that to work...but I'm better. We can use Garrenhoff's[sic] low profile against him.\nAgent Batanga: I say we stage a demonstration and get ourselves arrested. Rakt will haul us in to avoid undue attention. Then we break out and bring Gorr with us.\nScholar Krasso: Regrettably, I cannot participate. I must confer with my colleagues in the Priory, but I wish you luck. Let's regroup when the mission is complete.\nZojja: I want you to take it from here, Savant. I'm going with Krasso to help the Priory look into Gorr's theory.\nZojja: We both need to make inroads with the orders for my long-term plan to be viable. Work with whichever one here you think will get the job done.\n<Character name>: I will. I'm as eager to figure this out as you are. And eventually, you'll need to share some details about this \"long-range plan\" of yours.\nTalking to NPCs before choosing your course of action:\n\nZojja: Promulgating Gorr's theory is essential to the orders—and my long-range plans. If we're smart and play this right, we'll be perfectly positioned to confront the Elder Dragons.\n I'm with you.\nScholar Krasso: I'm glad to have a Snaff Savant among us. Between Batanga and Slep, things were getting a tad...lowbrow.\n Thanks. I'm always happy to raise the tone.\nCrusader Slep: Are you ready to go in and rescue Gorr with overwhelming force? Say the word, and I'll have a Vigil squad ready and waiting at the site.\n I'm in. Let's go kick down some doors.\n I need more time to think.\nAgent Batanga: I'm standing by to stage a fake protest and make the Arcane Eye take us into custody—right beside Gorr, where we want to be. Then we break out and take the good professor with us. Interested?\n You bet I am. Let's get started.\n I need more time to think.\nAfter choosing either plan:\n\nCrusader Slep: I like what I've seen so far, but do you have what it takes to fight for the Vigil on a full-time basis? I think you can, but you're going to have to prove it.\n If the opportunity arises, I'll be glad to.\nAgent Batanga: I hope you like creating mysteries as much as solving them. In the Order of Whispers, that's a necessary job skill.\n Thanks, but for the time being, I'm a free agent.\n\n\n== My story ==",

After gaining the uniform you will have to cause a distraction to lure the lab overseer away from Flax's office. This can be done by first causing each of the two tanks by the creature in the corner to fill up. After sabotaging the tanks, you must proceed to destroy one of the experimental consoles. This will let you sneak by the yelling overseer and grab the forged papers.\nAfter meeting with the agent at Gorr's lab, you must talk to the guard.

I like that. Your outfit, though...that'll get you noticed immediately.\n<Character name>: You had a plan for that, as I recall. There's no dearth of lab assistants to accost, but they're only doing their jobs.\n<Character name>: Do we really have to render one of them unconscious just to improve my sartorial splendor?\nAgent Batanga: I'll chalk that up to compassion rather than squeamishness...but no, we don't have to. Can you talk your way into a new set of clothes?\n<Character name>: \"Camouflaged reconnaissance\" is practically my middle name.\nTalking to Batanga after the cinematic:\n\nAgent Batanga: Now would be a good time to ask any questions. Once our business is underway, Batanga's Intrigue 101 class will no longer be in session.\n Good. I do have a few questions.\nYou ask, I answer. Just keep it simple. We've got work to do.\n What's the plan again?\nWe trick our way into Flax's offices, swipe what we need to make a convincing forgery, and then use the forgery to get past the Arcane Eye into Gorr's lab.\n I have another question.\n Got it. Let's move.\n Why does the Order of Whispers care about Gorr?\nHis theory could be the key to defeating the dragons. If we understand what they want, what they eat, we can use that against them.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n Why is this important? How big a threat are the Elder Dragons?\nThe biggest. Ever notice how recorded history only goes back so far? That's because Tyria had to start over after the last time the dragons rose. They wiped out nearly everything and everyone.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n I'm ready. Let's get to infiltrating.\n I'm ready now. Let's go.\nTalking to the Disgruntled Apprentice:\n\nDisgruntled Apprentice: I'm doing it! Can't you lay off for even a second? How can I get my work done if I'm defending myself from you all the time?\n Relax. It's clear you're overworked, so I'm here to relieve you.\nHow can you relieve me if you're not even on the staff here? Filka will take one look at you and start kicking until everybody's dead.\n Give me your uniform. I may not be as pretty as you, but I can fake it.\nSo Filka can trace this back to me? Nothing doing. Here, takes this spare outfit. Put it on, and keep your head down. I'm going to catch a nap in the heat exchangers. It's safer in there.\n Thanks.\n I offered to start my shift early and cover for you. If you don't want that...\nI do, but I just don't want to...oh, glitch it. Here. Take this spare uniform. I'm going to take an extended break and look for a new job.\n Good luck with that. Leave everything else to me.\n You're tired and cranky, and that makes you sloppy. Give me your uniform and clear out before I tell Filka how close you are to fouling up this whole operation.\nDon't do that! Here, take this spare. I'm gone. And if we're lucky, Filka will never notice you're not me. But if she does, it's your problem.\n I can handle it.\n Sorry to bother you.\n I'll come back when you're calmer.\nTalking to NPCs once inside the lab:\n\nAgent Batanga: The Order of Whispers is all about misdirection. A distraction here, a bit of commotion over there, and no one's looking at us. Ready to shake things up?\n So we don't have to worry about a fair fight or honorable combat?\nHeh. You're funny. Let me put it this way: if I was engaging a guy in single combat at dawn, I'd hamstring him and glue his sword in the scabbard the night before.\nI think I get it now. Thanks.\n I'm ready.\nFilka: Why are you talking to me? There's work to do. Get back to your post, or I'll knot your ears together and hang you from the ceiling like a decorative lamp.\n Right away, chief.\nWhile creating a distraction:\n\nFilka: Work, you feebs, or I'll toss you all into a pot and make a huge batch of simp stew.\nAgent Batanga: That's Flax's lab manager. A real pushover, right?\nFilka: You there! Did you forget what my boot feels like on your neck? Because I can remind you!\nAgent Batanga: Yep, a real pushover. We're going to need something flashy to make her leave her post.\n(interact with one storage tank)\nKrewe Researcher: Containment's at max capacity.

Unfortunately they don't want to let you in despite Krasso's bluff. Head around the back with Krasso and relinquish the Arcane Eye Agents of their two Hazmat Suits - the perfect disguises to get you inside. Return to the front door, where the guards let you in this time, and examine the Body Bag in the lab. By the time that you determine that the body is not Professor Gorr's, the guards have figured out that you are imposters. Kill the guards to trigger a cinematic with Rakt.\nMeet up with Zojja back in the Applied Development Lab to determine which order you will team up with for the next mission.

Rakt and his Arcane Eye troglodytes are no match for our combined intellects.\n I have a few questions before we begin.\nExcellent! Accepting the gaps in one's knowledge is the first step towards wisdom. What can I help you with?\n What's the plan again?\nWe're keeping it fluid at the moment, but the gist is that we sneak past the Arcane Eye using disguises and/or subterfuge, find evidence about what happened to Gorr, and then abscond.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n Why does the Priory care about Gorr?\nHis theory could show us how to defeat the Elder Dragons. The more we know, the more effectively we can combat them. Also, he's an unparallelled researcher. Call it a professional courtesy.\n Is that all?\nWell, if he's right and dragons eat magic, the Priory itself becomes a target. With the amount of magical objects we have storehoused, our home base is a draconic buffet of deliciousness.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n Why is this important? How big a threat are the Elder Dragons?\nIn a word? Unimaginable. Catastrophic. We believe that the last time the dragons rose, they razed Tyria and everything on it down to the bare rock.\n I have another question.\n That's all I needed to know.\n That's all I needed to know.\n You said it. Let's go.\nApproaching the front entrance:\n\nScholar Krasso: What's going on here? We have an appointment with—\nArcane Eye Agent: There's nothing going on and nothing to see here, citizen.\nScholar Krasso: But we need to get inside. We're expected.\nArcane Eye Agent: My orders come from Agent Rakt himself, and he says no one get in without clearance from the Arcane Council. Move along.\nCinematic with Scholar Krasso:\n\nScholar Krasso: Empirically speaking, we're not getting in through the front door. The guards won't risk getting on Rakt's bad side. He's a particularly nasty character.\nScholar Krasso: We need a better plan, and fast. The Priory's reliquaries are full of magical items. If the dragons feed on magic, those reliquaries become prime targets.\n<Character name>: We could overpower the guards, grab what we need, and fight our way out.\nScholar Krasso: Too public. We don't want to alert the entire Arcane Eye...and everyone else in the vicinity. We need to think our way in.\nScholar Krasso: Rakt is meticulous, and cautious. He would have sent hazmat suits in to analyse dangerous areas in the lab. Follow my lead. I've got an idea.\nSubduing the Arcane Eye agents:\n\nScholar Krasso: Do you study astronomy? Because you're about to see stars!\nArcane Eye Agent: What the—quit it! Help!\nScholar Krasso: Grab a hazmat suit. Once we're disguised, they won't look twice.\nOn entering the lab:\n\nArcane Eye Agent: We've got hazmat golems coming in. Open the doors!\nScholar Krasso: Look there. I believe the common parlance is a \"body bag.\"\nCinematic examining the body bag:\n\n<Character name>: Look at this, Krasso. I don't know this poor devil, but it's definitely not Gorr.\nScholar Krasso: I concur. The Arcane Eye must have him socked away somewhere. And if Gorr's not here, there's no need for us to linger.\n<Character name>: Agreed. But what do you think happened here? Does the Priory have any information or insight that could explain this?\nScholar Krasso: We have entire libraries full of information on the Arcane Eye, on Rakt, on Gorr's research. But this doesn't make any sense to me...yet.\nScholar Krasso: Of course, we need to be alive and unincarcerated to learn more. With that in mind, let's make a graceful exit before Rakt gets wise.\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nArcane Eye Agent: You there! Nobody's supposed to be on shift right now. Identify yourself!\nScholar Krasso: We're the special task detail. Our orders are to examine all the, um...\nArcane Eye Agent: You're not a member of this krewe. Who are you and what are you doing here?\nScholar Krasso: We're just...uh...oh, never mind. Time to fight!\nArcane Eye Agent: Intruders! Shut down all hazmat suits! This area is compromised!\nArcane Eye Agent: Call for backup. We've got intruders in Sector 7!\nAfter defeating Arcane Eye Agents:\n\nRakt: Freeze! Anybody moves, you all get liquidated.\nCinematic with Rakt:\n\nRakt: What's going on here? Who are you?\nScholar Krasso: We're admirers of Gorr's work. We came to pay our respects to his body, but as you can see, it's not here.\nRakt: I have no idea what you're talking about. There's nothing even remotely out of the ordinary here. Except you.\nRakt: Since this is a secure area, and since you're not authorized to be here...run. Or I will exercise my right to use lethal force.\n<Character name>: Let's go, Krasso. I want to regroup with the others and find out what they and Zojja make of this.\nAfter cinematic:\n\nScholar Krasso: Carry on, Savant. I'll meet up [sic] you and the others later.\nSpeaking with Rakt before you leave:\n\nRakt: I don't know who you are, which means you don't belong here. Move along before I do something gruesomely official to you as an example to other snoopers.\n I'm already gone.\n\n\n=== Applied Development Lab ===\nUpon approaching the order representatives:\n\nCrusader Slep: So Gorr's \"death\" was a fraud. How does knowing that help us? The problem is still Elder Dragons.\nCrusader Slep: While you poke around in back alleys or libraries for information, the Vigil is out there fighting.\nAgent Batanga: And while you're fighting, Whispers is setting up the means to deliver a death blow.\nAgent Batanga: We appreciate the distraction you provide, but you don't really think you're going to overpower an Elder Dragon, do you?\nScholar Krasso: Swords alone won't get results. Neither will intrigue. The Priory supports a more holistic approach.\nScholar Krasso: We intend to learn all we can about the dragons and their weaknesses before we strike.\nCinematic with the Order Representatives:\n\n<Character name>: Rakt's Arcane Eye agents were all over Gorr's lab. They removed a body they claimed was Gorr, but it wasn't. I suspect he's still alive.\nZojja: If he is, the Arcane Eye has him. They run a remote facility in a human village called Garenhoff. It's isolated, remote...a perfect place to stash Gorr.\nCrusader Slep: Finally, a concrete objective. Just say the word and I'll have Vigil soldiers standing by to storm Garenhoff.\nAgent Batanga: No, Rakt is too good at this game for that to work...but I'm better. We can use Garrenhoff's[sic] low profile against him.\nAgent Batanga: I say we stage a demonstration and get ourselves arrested. Rakt will haul us in to avoid undue attention. Then we break out and bring Gorr with us.\nScholar Krasso: Regrettably, I cannot participate. I must confer with my colleagues in the Priory, but I wish you luck. Let's regroup when the mission is complete.\nZojja: I want you to take it from here, Savant. I'm going with Krasso to help the Priory look into Gorr's theory.\nZojja: We both need to make inroads with the orders for my long-term plan to be viable. Work with whichever one here you think will get the job done.\n<Character name>: I will. I'm as eager to figure this out as you are. And eventually, you'll need to share some details about this \"long-range plan\" of yours.\nTalking to NPCs before choosing your course of action:\n\nZojja: Promulgating Gorr's theory is essential to the orders—and my long-range plans. If we're smart and play this right, we'll be perfectly positioned to confront the Elder Dragons.\n I'm with you.\nScholar Krasso: I'm glad to have a Snaff Savant among us. Between Batanga and Slep, things were getting a tad...lowbrow.\n Thanks. I'm always happy to raise the tone.\nCrusader Slep: Are you ready to go in and rescue Gorr with overwhelming force? Say the word, and I'll have a Vigil squad ready and waiting at the site.\n I'm in. Let's go kick down some doors.\n I need more time to think.\nAgent Batanga: I'm standing by to stage a fake protest and make the Arcane Eye take us into custody—right beside Gorr, where we want to be. Then we break out and take the good professor with us. Interested?\n You bet I am. Let's get started.\n I need more time to think.\nChoosing either plan:\n\nAgent Batanga: I hope you like creating mysteries as much as solving them. In the Order of Whispers, that's a necessary job skill.\n Thanks, but for the time being, I'm a free agent.\nCrusader Slep: I like what I've seen so far, but do you have what it takes to fight for the Vigil on a full-time basis? I think you can, but you're going to have to prove it.\n If the opportunity arises, I'll be glad to.\n\n\n== My story ==",

      "strWikiText": "A Meeting of the Minds is part of the personal story of asura characters. It is selected by becoming a member of the Durmand Priory in the previous mission.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nHelp the Durmand Priory stage a conference to spread Gorr's theory.\n\nMeet Krasso and Gorr at the College of Synergetics.\nProtect Gorr while he presents his theory.\nDefeat the hostile golems.\nUse the control console to reprogram the golems to fight the fires.\nDefeat Rakt.\nSpeak with High Councillor Flax.\nTalk to Zojja.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\nClick here to edit the reward data\n\nAll professions\n6,523 \n  Spirit Shard\n  Box of Lab Equipment (Fine)\n  Priory Pride\n  Durmand Priory Weapon Container\nProfession-specific\n   Swelter's Gait\n   Trackless Boots\n   Blessed Steps\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nDuring the conference, Rakt will boldly interrupt to announce the planned death of Professor Gorr. He detonates some explosives on the walls and activates a couple of BAT 9929 golems to terminate every asura in the college. The first battle is against the golems. It is advised to watch out for their ranged attacks, which take out large portions of your total health and will kill an unprepared player. Dodging backwards once should be enough. Their other attacks are weaker, but still potentially lethal. Focus fire on one golem at a time to avoid being overrun by the group, unless you are comfortable enough in taking one multiple at once. The allied NPCs will revive their allies, so don't worry too much about resurrecting.\nAfter the golems have been defeated, you are asked to activate the control console to have the golems extinguish the fire in the college. This will also extinguish the flame walls leading into the rest of Rata Sum, where Rakt is waiting. Upon approaching Rakt, a cutscene will trigger, and you will face him directly. After the previous battle, Rakt should pose little to no threat. Beware of falling off the bridge into the lower area, this will reset the entire mission and you will have to begin from the start.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nFaculty Leader Pokk\nHigh Councillor Flax\nProfessor Gorr\nScholar Krasso\nZojja\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nAsura\nRakt\nGolems\nBAT 9929\n\n\n== Objects ==\nConsole\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nApproaching Zojja:\n\nZojja: Gorr's ready to start. Can't wait to hear what you've discovered.\nZojja waves at <Character name>.\nSpeaking with Zojja:\n\nZojja: The Priory's plan is promising. A conference like this is one of the fastest ways to spread Gorr's message among the academic elite. It may not be flashy, but it's effective.\n Is Mr. Sparkles joining us?\nNot this time. Rakt is watching us, so I sent Sparkles on a decoy mission to sow confusion and buy us some time. Right now he's \"investigating\" an Arcane Eye base on the other side of town.\n Good plan. I'll miss him, but it's a good plan.\n Definitely. That's why I chose it.\nAt the conference:\n\nFaculty Leader Pokk: I've gathered the finest minds in the world for this, Gorr. You'd best not disappoint them.\nProfessor Gorr: Excuse me. The final member of my research team has arrived.\nProfessor Gorr: If you and the audience are ready, we can begin.\nFaculty Leader Pokk: Outstanding. Looking forward to your presentation, Professor. I'll introduce you.\nFaculty Leader Pokk: My fellow geniuses, please join the College of Synergetics in welcoming Professor Gorr.\nProfessor Gorr: Thank you for coming. You may have already heard my theory about the Elder Dragons consuming magic.\nProfessor Gorr: Today, I'm here to present incontrovertible proof of that theory. Proof, and a warning.\nProfessor Gorr: If left unchecked, the dragons will consume every last iota of magic in the world.\nRakt: Ladies and gentlemen, this presentation has been canceled on account of death. Yours.\nSpeaking with Faculty Leader Pokk:\n\nFaculty Leader Pokk: Every top-flight geniuses[sic] in Rata Sum is here. Gorr has his message and now we've given him the means to disseminate it...I just hope the Arcane Eye allows it.\n We don't need their permission. We have me\n Rakt would have to be insane to threaten a gathering this big.\n Rakt's dirty tricks are no match for the brain power in this room.\n Take cover and leave this to me.\nCinematic with Rakt:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Stop! Silencing me won't help you now. Besides, I'm only trying to help defeat the dragons.\nRakt: Then you should have stayed in your cell. Now I have to kill everyone here and burn the room. What a waste of time.\nScholar Krasso: It's a waste of a great deal more than time. Don't do this, Agent. Concealing the threat posed by the dragons helps no one and hurts everyone.\n<Character name>: You can't control the truth, Rakt. Things have already gone too far.\nRakt: That may be true, but you're not going any farther. Instead, you're all going to die, right here, right now.\nAfter cinematic:\n\nRakt: I've sealed all the doors. Now to turn up the heat.\nBAT 9929: Emergency—protocols—activated. Beginning—attack—sequence.\nFighting the fire:\n\nProfessor Gorr: If we can reach the console, I believe we can reprogram the golems to fight fire.\nConsole: Conflagration detected. Emergency override activated. Engage fire-suppression protocols?\n Yes. Extinguish all fires.\nBAT 9929: Switching—to—fire—suppression—mode.\nBAT 9929: Threat—neutralized. Deactivating.\nScholar Krasso: Now that the flames have been snuffed, it's Rakt's turn.\nSpeaking with your allies:\n\nScholar Krasso: I didn't think the Arcane Eye would kill everyone in the room just to silence Gorr, but clearly I was wrong.\n Good thing Gorr has us on his side.\nProfessor Gorr: This is ridiculous! Every time I try to share my theory, I'm either kidnapped, incarcerated, or set on fire.\n After today, It'll never happen again. I promise.\nZojja: Gorr's presentation was just the first phase. From here on, things start to get tricky.\n That's okay. I'm not leaving until the job is done.\nFaculty Leader Pokk: They're going to kill us all, aren't they? I know progress demands a vigorous exchange of views, but this is a bit too vigorous.\n Not for me. I've got a score to settle with Rakt.\n The truth is always worth fighting for.\n Think of it as a \"physical debate.\" With fire.\n Take cover and leave this to me.\nCinematic with Rakt:\n\n<Character name>: It's over, Rakt. Everyone here heard Gorr's message, and they're about to spread it across Tyria.\nScholar Krasso: And when the Council sees what you've done, they'll have your head.\nRakt: The Council can be extremely myopic when it suits them. Besides, once you're all dead, there'll be nothing left for them to see.\n<Character name>: It doesn't have to end like that. You're loyal, but you're also smart. You can still walk away from this.\nRakt: But you can't. My orders are clear. None of you leaves here alive.\nAfter defeating Rakt, High Councillor Flax arrives (cinematic):\n\nProfessor Gorr: Here. You see, Councillor Flax? Everything I said is true! The Arcane Eye have been trying to supress[sic] my theory that the dragons are eating magic.\nProfessor Gorr: My correct theory, I might add. We now have proof that the dragons do consume magic.\nCouncillor Flax: We know, Professor. We've always known. Preparations are being made to exploit your \"discovery\" for Rata Sum's benefit even as we speak.\n<Character name>: Then Rakt was working for you all along. You used the Arcane Eye to get Gorr out of the way so you could stifle the truth.\nZojja: You won't get away with this. We'll tell the world. We'll distribute Gorr's research. We'll—\nCouncillor Flax: You'll make a lot of shrill noise, as always. And as always, no one will listen or care. You're wasting the Council's time. This audience is over.\nCinematic with Zojja:\n\n<Character name>: I had no idea the Council was corrupt enough to hoard information that could help Tyria deal with the dragons.\nScholar Krasso: They obviously think they can keep themselves safe in Rata Sum. But the more power they stockpile, the faster the dragons will come for them.\nZojja: Listen, I've fought the dragons, and I am telling you they have no chance. The only hope Tyria has is for all races to join forces.\nScholar Krasso: That's the Priory's current mission. But I think I can handle things in Rata Sum from here on out. The Durmand Priory has bigger plans for you, Novice.\nScholar Krasso: It's time to take the fight to the dragon. Head to Lion's Arch. A Priory contact is waiting for you. She'll give you your first official mission.\nZojja: Congratulations. Getting you into an order was the first step. Now for the tricky part: I'm bound for Lion's Arch, too. I'm meeting an...old friend there.\nZojja: We were members of a brilliant team, Destiny's Edge. Things went...horribly wrong, but I'm starting to think the team is worth another try.\nZojja: We almost took down an Elder Dragon without any help. But the dragons are too big for one group to tackle.\nZojja: Tyria needs their experience...and Destiny's Edge needs all the help they can get. Once you're settled in at the Durmand Priory, I may call on you again.\n<Character name>: I'll be honored to answer that call. As a member of the Priory, a citizen of Tyria, and your friend, I'll be ready.\nZojja: Thank you. This may fail, but I have to at least try. I wouldn't feel that way if not for you. I'll meet you in Lion's Arch.\nSpeaking with your allies:\n\nProfessor Gorr: I've often suspected Councillor Flax of having a hidden agenda. I'm sorry my theory has caused everyone such trouble, but I also thank you for helping me present it to the world.\n You're welcome. Now let's put your theory to practical use against the dragons.\nZojja: Nice work, Savant...I mean, initiate[sic]. With both of us attacking the Elder Dragon problem from different angles, I'm a lot more confident about our chances of success.\n Same here. I'll keep an eye out for you in Lion's Arch.\nScholar Krasso: Well, despite the council's betrayal, we've done well here today. I see a bright future for you in the Priory. Good luck in Lion's Arch.\n Thanks.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

After a cinematic, Agent Batanga will provide you with some Amnesia Gas that can be used to disable the two Peacekeeper guards protecting the outer console.\nOnce the guards have been disabled, Professor Gorr will use the console to bypass the defense systems and re-program the golems to broadcast the famous message. During this process, unfortunately, two of the Veteran PM-700z Golems will be activated and will attack the player - kill or stall them until the hacking is complete. After defeating them, another cutscene will ensue, with Rakt spouting his nonsense, and incriminating the Arcane Council in the conspiracy to suppress Professor Gorr's data (to their own profit). Following this scene, Rakt attempts to follow through on his threat to kill everyone who knows.\nAfter defeating Rakt, you need to proceed to the base of the Council chambers and confront Councillor Flax and his allies, (Councillor Ludo and Councillor Zudo) who confirm your conspiracy fears, and dismiss you as \"inconsequential\".

I can't even begin to calculate the outcome!\n Just stick close and watch. You'll see exactly how it turns out.\nCinematic:\n\nAgent Batanga: Ready to enter the world of epic espionage? Ready to outintrigue a master spy like Rakt? It all starts here at the Peacemaker headquarters.\nProfessor Gorr: I'm ready. I may not be a covert operative like you, but if you can get me inside, I can reprogram Rata Sum's golems to transmit my message.\nAgent Batanga: That's the spirit. First we need to neutralize the guards and secure the area. And for Professor Gorr's sake, let's do so swiftly and suavely.\n<Character name>: I can do suave. Just go easy on the clever jokes, all right? Groaning in disgust tends to impede my natural grace.\nAgent Batanga: You wound me! I'll have you know, wordplay of that caliber takes an enormous amount of work.\n<Character name>: Then you should take a sabbatical. Right now, I'm only interested in repurposing those golems.\nZojja: The Savant's right. Rakt will be here as soon as he figures out what's going on. We need to move, and move quickly.\nSpeaking with Batanga:\n\nAgent Batanga: Remember: Our objective is the golem master control panel. We aren't mass murderers, though, so use this amnesia gas to knock out the guards.\n I need more amnesia gas.\nSorry, I'm only authorized to give out one dose per agent. Come back once you've used it. (if already with amnesia gas)\n Ok.\n Amnesia gas?\nYes, it was derived from some stolen Inquest chemical weapons. It's been rendered harmless, but it will knock out the target, and wipe their short term memory.\n Sounds very useful, why haven't I heard of it?\nIt's very expensive, and difficult to make. That's why I'm only authorized to provide you with a single does[sic] at a time.\n I'll be careful with it.\n Interesting. Thanks.\n Count on me.\nOn the way to the console:\n\nKrewe Researcher: Don't usually see so many Arcane Eye agents around. It's making me nervous.\nKrewe Researcher: Shhh! They'll hear you. Better nervous than in a cell with electrodes wired to your ears.\nWhile Professor Gorr reprograms the golems:\n\nAgent Batanga: These tools should help avoid unneeded casualties.\nAgent Batanga: Look sharp. No telling what defenses these golems have. Gorr, you're with me.\nAgent Batanga: Their defenses are more robust than I expected. Watch my back while I work.\nAgent Batanga: Nice work. We're nearly there.\nAgent Batanga: Watch it! Here comes another one.\nAgent Batanga: We're on the air. Nothing can stop the signal now!\nPM-700z: Professor—Gorr—would—like—to—inform—you—that—dragons—consume—magic. Thank—you.\nRakt: Halt! Nobody move.\nSpeaking with Batanga:\n\nAgent Batanga: Keep the security forces at bay so I can concentrate on this control panel.\n You got it.\nSpeaking with Gorr:\n\nProfessor Gorr: This is decidedly more violent than I anticipated. In fact, I've never conducted an experiment with so much...hitting.\n Consider it a new type of research and development.\nCinematic confronting Rakt:\n\nRakt: Stop right there. How did you dissidents bypass my security measures?\nAgent Batanga: That's a trade secret, flatfoot. Though if you must know, we walked in. Then we walked all over your scheme to suppress Gorr's theory.\nRakt: No matter. When I'm done, your \"revelation\" will be dismissed as just more gossip. Oh, and by the way: you'll all be dead.\nAgent Batanga: Now you're just being obvious. I used to respect the Arcane Eye as a worthy adversary in intrigue, but this is downright vulgar.\n<Character name>: You lost, Rakt. Even if you could kill us, what's the point? Oh, and by the way: you can't.\nRakt: The point is I have clear orders and a job to do. Oh, and I'm very, very good at my job. One way or another, this ends now.\nCinematic after defeating Rakt:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Victory! My theory is broadcasting to everyone in the vicinity, and the villainous Rakt received his comeuppance. Once again, you have my thanks.\n<Character name>: We haven't won yet, Professor. The Arcane Council needs to know what Rakt was doing in their name.\nAgent Batanga: Agreed. Although, I have the sneaking suspicion some of them already know. We'll see if I'm right.\nZojja: The Councillors are in their chambers on the top floor of the city. Let's go inform them of what their favorite secret policeman was up to.\nSpeaking with Batanga:\n\nAgent Batanga: So much for Agent Rakt. I guess that proves who Tyria's premiere spymasters are. Now then, let's see what the council says about their rogue agent.\n Agreed.\nSpeaking with Gorr:\n\nProfessor Gorr: I'm not a vengeful person, but I must admit that I'll sleep a lot better without that reprobate Rakt around. He got exactly what he deserved. I just wish he'd gotten it sooner.\n We dealt with Rakt. Now we deal with his handlers.\nRepeated over and over by the golems:\n\nPM-700z: Professor—Gorr—would—like—to—inform—you—that—dragons—consume—magic. Thank—you.\nPM-700z: Professor—Gorr—says, \"Elder—Dragons—eat—magic—until—there's—none—left.\" Tell—your—friends.\nPM-700z: Your—attention—please: The—dragons—are—drawn—to—and—consume—powerful—magic. Plan—accordingly.\nPM-700z: The—Arcane—Eye—is—suppressing—the—truth. The—dragons—consume—magic—until—all—available—magic—is—gone.\nCinematic with the Arcane Council:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Here. You see, Councillor Flax? Everything I said is true! The Arcane Eye have been trying to suppress my theory that the dragons are eating magic.\nProfessor Gorr: My correct theory, I might add. We now have proof that the dragons do consume magic.\nCouncillor Flax: We know, Professor. We've always known. Preparations are being made to exploit your \"discovery\" for Rata Sum's benefit even as we speak.\n<Character name>: Then Rakt was working for you all along. You used the Arcane Eye to get Gorr out of the way so you could stifle the truth.\nZojja: You won't get away with this. We'll tell the world. We'll distribute Gorr's research. We'll—\nCouncillor Flax: You'll make a lot of shrill noise, as always. And as always, no one will listen or care. You're wasting the Council's time. This audience is over.\nSpeaking with Flax:\n\nCouncillor Flax: Your alacrity is inspiring, but you really must leave governing to those equipped to handle it. The council will decide what's best for Rata Sum.\n What about the rest of Tyria?\nDon't be absurd. The world's best and only hope is for us to start running it. When Rata Sum defeats the dragons, Tyria will fall to its knees and beg us to rule it.\n You have no idea how wrong you are.\n Spoken like a truly corrupt, out-of-touch has-been.\nI am entirely unaccustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Mind your manners, or I'll have you sent to the dredge mines to dig out ore with a rusty spoon.\n Sorry, old man. I reserve the right to call a fool a fool.\n Decide all you like. The Order of Whispers has other plans.\nSpeaking with Batanga:\n\nAgent Batanga: Our short but very sweet partnership has come to an end. I'll make sure Gorr remains safe. Good luck in Lion's Arch, and again, welcome to the only order that matters.\n What can I expect in Lion's Arch?\nWell, I haven't been fully briefed on what they have planned for you, but you know the basics: mercantile city, survived the rising of Orr, melting pot for all races. You'll be fine.\n With detailed advice like that, how can I go wrong?\n Thanks.\nSpeaking with Gorr:\n\nProfessor Gorr: I can't say I'm surprised by the council's position, but I am extremely disappointed. Can't they see how much we all stand to lose by suppressing the truth? How can they be so short-sighted?\n It's called \"blind ambition\" for a reason.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nOriginally offered Whisper's Healer, Whisper's Precision or a different variant of Whisper's Power as a reward.",

Gorr will show the player the weapon he is working on, and ask the player to test the prototype by defeating groups of Risen enemies. Although you have to pick up the weapon to progress the mission, you do not have to use it to defeat the foes.\nGorr will release creatures in groups of three, allowing you time to practice. After these groups are killed off, miscommunication in the lab results in several more Risen being released. Gorr does not participate in any of the battles; Trahearne only helps in the final battle, although he will revive you if you are downed.\n\nTest #1: Three Risen Grubs\nTest #2: Three Risen Krait Nimross\nTest #3: Three miscellaneous Risen.\nAccidental release: includes a Risen Gorilla and 4-5 others.\nUse the testing phase to learn the weapon's key strengths:\n\nThe basic attack grows based on the number of charges held by the weapon, up to a maximum of three.\nThis charges the weapon. You can only grab one charge from a foe at a time, i.e. use it on three different foes to store the maximum number of charges.\nDischarges the weapon. This also pulls the target towards you and confuses it (i.e. reduces attack and movement speeds).\nKicks the target back.\nThe most effective technique is to maximize the weapon's first skill by kiting and using the second skill on three different foes. You can also prepare for the next wave by charging the weapon in the earlier waves and never discharging it.\nAnother effective method:\n\nUse the second attack to charge the weapon, which will suck the enemies to you, dazing some.\nAfter gathering a charge, the third attack will unlock; the weapon can store up to three charges.\nUse Kick and Discharge to push back enemies while the vacuum charges.\nWhen fully charged, the third attack's icon will show a small skull.\nRinse and repeat. Try not to take on all of the Risen in the lab at once; they're still very strong as a group.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nProfessor Gorr\nSylvari\nTrahearne\nGolem\nINT-R COM\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nRisen\nRisen Abomination\nRisen Brute\nRisen Gorilla\nRisen Grub\nRisen Krait Damoss\nRisen Krait Nimross\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nUpon finding Gorr's lab:\n\nTrahearne: Gorr's waiting by his lab. Approach cautiously. Something seems amiss.\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: Gorr looks beside himself. Is it me, or does his lab seem full of Orrian undead?\nIf asura:\n Don't worry. I know Gorr. I'm sure he has this situation handled.\nOtherwise:\n That's what it looks like. I'm sure he can explain.\nApproaching Gorr (Cutscene):\n\nIf asura:\n<Character Name>: Professor Gorr? It's good to see you again!\nProfessor Gorr: Savant! Bless my geodes! You must be my Order of Whispers contact. I'm to say \"buckets of fun\" when I see you.\nOtherwise:\n<Character Name>: Excuse me, but I have a shipment of apples for a \"Gorr.\" Are you Gorr?\nProfessor Gorr: I certainly hope I'm Gorr—I'm wearing his underwear! You must be my Order of Whispers contact. I'm to say \"buckets of fun\" in response.\nProfessor Gorr: As you can see, there's trouble! Yes, yes, look all you like, the doors are transparent. There are Risen in my lab!\nProfessor Gorr: I'm developing a weapon based on my theory of draconic enchanto-consumption. Essentially, it removes the magic from a person or object, poisons it, and then transfers it back.\nProfessor Gorr: Hypothetically, the Vacuumagic Polarizer will reverse the magical essence of Zhaitan's tangible will within the Risen, and therefore, destroy them.\nTrahearne: A cunning idea. Does the weapon work?\nProfessor Gorr: Mmm. Theoretically. My associates at the Upsilon Facility sent me test subjects, but the creatures...erm...got away, as you can see.\n<Character Name>: Don't worry, Gorr. Give me one of your prototypes, and we'll kill two blights with one stone—testing the weapon while clearing the lab.\nAfter cinematic:\n\nProfessor Gorr: This way to the Vacuumagic Polarizers! Follow me.\nINT-R COM: How goes the testing? Gorr? Gorr, are you there?\nTalking to Gorr:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Go on, grab a Vacuumagic Polarizer from the weapon rack and let's get started.\n As easy as that, huh? All right, then.\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: I look forward to seeing this weapon's capabilities. They must be quite impressive.\n I hope you're right.\nAfter picking up the weapon:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Beautiful, aren't they? The first button fires a basic defrasic bolt. The simple bolt will grow more powerful as the polarizer is charged.\nProfessor Gorr: The second button activates the vacuumagic inhalation, sucking magic from the target. This charges the polarizer. The weapon can store up to three charges.\nProfessor Gorr: The weapon depolarizes any enchantments it holds, and the third button empties those charges into a mighty arcane arrow. Fully charged, it packs a mighty wallop!\nProfessor Gorr: Take the Polarizer to the lab and we'll \"quantify\" a test subject.\nAt the lab entrance - releasing the first wave:\n\nProfessor Gorr: I'll open the color-spectrum filter, allowing only certain wavelengths to pass. That way they'll come out in small groups.\nProfessor Gorr: Green, then blue. Red last, of course. The most dangerous things are always the red ones. Ready? Here we go!\nTrahearne: I would be surprised if Zhaitan even bothers with controlling its lesser minions. They do nothing but destroy.\nReleasing the second wave:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Analytical metrics seem favorable. Try charging the polarizer two or three times before you fire. Your output should grow exponentially.\nProfessor Gorr: Next filter disengaged. Time for the blue ones! Ah, blue. The color of oceans and my artichokes. The ones I made while dabbling in organic chemistry, that is...\nTrahearne: These seem to be more powerful. They also hold a larger quantity of magic. More of Zhaitan's will, perhaps?\n<INT-R COM>: Gorr? Sir, are you there? Upsilon Facility to Gorr...\nReleasing the third wave:\n\nProfessor Gorr: The Vacumagic Polarizer is doing even better than anticipated! We're out of beta. This is fantastic!\nProfessor Gorr: Releasing the red filter. These should be the worst of them, if my apprenticeship taught me anything at all!\nTrahearne: Indeed, these creatures are acting with more self-will! Zhaitan's infused them with tremendous energy. See how the weapon affects them!\n<INT-R COM>: Hello, Gorr? Hey, look! A gorilla. A gorilla for Gorr! Ha!\nTalking to Professor Gorr:\n\nProfessor Gorr: You'll find an optimal testing area at the bottom of the stairs, agent. Do you remember how the Vacuumagic Polarizer functions?\n Remind me.\nThe polarizer's second button activates the vacuumagic inhalation. The third button notes the buildup of charges.\n What about the first and fifth buttons?\nThe first button fires a defrastic bolt. The fifth reverses the weapon's polarity, de-vacuuming the enemy - er, I mean knocking them back.\n I'll try to remember.\n That's all I needed to know. Thanks.\n I remember how this works. It's good to see you, by the way. (if asura)\nIt's good to see you too, Savant, but now isn't the best time to catch up. Let's clean up the lab, test these weapons, and then we can chat.\n Sounds good.\n I'll figure it out. How hard can it be?\nAfter clearing the first three waves:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Brilliant. I'm brilliant! It works beautifully. The Vacuumagic Polarizer is ready for Orr!\n<INT-R COM>: Ready for more? You heard him, apprentices. Get the—onto the teleporter pad!\nProfessor Gorr: What? No! I said Orr, not more! Gah. This INT-R-COM's a mess!\n<INT-R COM>: What's that? Time to send the rest? Oh-kaaay! Incoming!\nTalking to Gorr:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Gah, get them off me!\n Don't worry.\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: You test the weapon. If things get out of hand, I'll be here to lend a hand.\n Thanks.\nAfter defeating all the Risen (cutscene):\n\nProfessor Gorr: Magnificent! The Vacuummagic Polarizer destroyed the Risen...er, hm, and my lab. Ah, well, that's what apprentices are for.\n<Character name>: Your weapon was extremely effective against the servants of Zhaitan. It'll be instrumental in recapturing Claw Island.\nProfessor Gorr: I'll take the prototypes to Lion's Arch immediately. It's the least I can do. The Order of Whispers saved my life.\nTrahearne: Will you be all right cleaning up here, Gorr?\nProfessor Gorr: Yes, yes. Once my apprentices return from the Upsilon Facility, I'll put them on it. And, er, mental note: fix aural relay on the INT-R COM.\nAfter the cutscene:\n\nTrahearne: I dreamed of Orr, as Caithe did. But where she saw a dragon to fight, I saw a land to heal.\nTrahearne: At least Caithe had a tangible target. I barely knew where to begin.\nTrahearne: Such brave people willing to risk so much. But do we even have a chance at victory?\nCutscene with Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: Lightbringer, the Orrians are firmly entrenched. It will be incredibly difficult to regain Claw Island.\n<Character name>: We can't give up hope, Trahearne.\nTrahearne: I haven't. In fact, I'm counting on hope to lead the way. To that end, we should ask for wisdom from the Pale Tree.\nTrahearne: If anyone knows how to defeat Zhaitan, it is the Mother. Meet me at the Grove, and we'll speak with her before the battle.\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: That weapon is masterful. It will greatly aid our efforts on Claw Island after we speak with the Pale Tree.\nIf sylvari:\n Why return to the Grove now?\nI can think of no better place to begin this journey than the boughs of the Great Mother. She will aid us with our Wyld Hunts against Zhaitan and Orr.\n Remind me, what is your Wyld Hunt?\nThe cleansing of Orr. She has often aided me, when all seemed at its darkest. (same as below)\nOtherwise:\n The Pale Tree?\nThe Pale Tree is the mother of the sylvari race. She is the memory of our people, the collected knowledge of generations. She will aid us.\n How can she help us?\nThe cleansing of Orr. She has often aided me, when all seemed at its darkest.\n If she's as wise as you, then this is the right decision.\nYou are too kind, <Character name>. Thank you.\n Anytime.\n I'll see you at the Grove.\nTalking to Gorr:\n\nProfessor Gorr: Well done! I'm positively overjoyed. Such suction! Such destruction!\nIf asura:\n How have you been?\nWell, I certainly haven't been lonely thanks to your cohorts at the Order of Whispers. They've treated me kindly.\n I hope you're rested. You'll need to be ready for Claw Island.\n Why is your lab so far out in the wilderness?\nMy theories about the dragons put me at odds with the Arcane Council. There was death, mayhem—all manner of nonsense.\n So now you stay here, where they can't find you. Very wise.\n This weapon will be a great asset to the Order of Whispers.\nInteracting with INT-R COM:\n\n<INT-R COM>: ..ey! Gorr! How'd you like the last...ample we sent? Are...isolation chambers...orking?\n You screwed up the coordinates and nearly killed us!\n...d up? Me?...idn't know! Oh, bother and bo...sterbash!\n You need a swift kick in the golem.\n I think Gorr has had enough for today.\n...ood! I can't wait until...test! We've got some great...inations lined up!\n I really hope they don't try anything soon.\n You sent too many. The lab was overrun. Cut it out! (<quality>)\nWait, you mean we...into the lab? How...arassing! Please, tell Gorr we're sorry.\n Understood.\n Great. Just great. Idiots.\n\n\n== My story ==",

The quest markers lead you around the city, although it is largely up to you to decide how you want to get there. The next marker is triggered when the vision of the tree talks to Trahearne. If the first conversation does not trigger you should logout and restart.\nAlong the way, you will encounter Orr Spectral foes. These are basically enchanted weapons that move on their own. Some of them are already floating about, but others only spawn when you get close enough to them - you will notice the weapons lying on the ground. Avoid getting near them if you want to prevent unnecessary fights.\nUpon reaching a certain area, you will see a vision of Trahearne's future, where he is rallying troops to fight against Zhaitan. These consist of members of all three Orders. After the speech, these illusory fighters will charge forward and two large groups of Risen will spawn. An all-out battle takes place; kill all the Risen to proceed. The NPCs are pretty strong and can handle the enemies on their own for the most part. You must kill all of the Risen Giants in order to continue. It is possible to skip this part by following the path to the southwest or by just hanging back and trying to avoid aggro.\nAfter the battle you are led to visions of Destiny's Edge and will learn the reason for their split up when you talk to them.\nProceeding further into the city, you will enter the Royal Tombs. A few Risen spawn along the way; they are location-based, so move slowly to avoid triggering too many at once. At the end of the tomb, you will have to fight an Eye of Zhaitan. It has a beam attack that causes Confusion, shoots lightning balls, and can also spin in place to cause heavy damage to anyone nearby. Use of ranged weapons and extra summoned extra allies are very useful here, since Trahearne deals almost no damage and the Eye tends to not target him.\nAfter defeating the Eye, you talk to the ghost of the Last King of Orr, who tells you to seek the source of the corruption, and implies that Zhaitan himself is not the cause. The quest marker will point you to another location in the city. There are several Orr Spectrals along the way; they don't move, so avoiding them is easy. Once you reach the location, your final task is to defeat the Risen Gatekeeper. He is a hammer-wielding foe, but oddly enough hits for very little damage and moves slowly, making the fight very easy. Trahearne will receive the magical sword Caladbolg just before this fight.\nOnce the Gatekeeper is defeated, the \"vision\" ends and you are transported back to The Grove. Speak to the Pale Tree to finish the mission.\nAt the end of the mission, the Pale Tree asks your character of their greatest fear. The player will have to choose one of three options, this choice () will determine which missions the character takes part in during the seventh (the next) personal story chapter. You may wish to check over the missions in each path before making your choice, excluding story steps common to all paths, these missions are:\n\nLet an innocent die: Tower Down → Munition Acquisition / To The Core → Breaking the Bone Ship → A Sad Duty\nDishonor my allies: Shell Shock → Volcanic Extraction / Fixing the Blame → Marshaling the Truth → Delivering Justice\nMake another suffer: Striking Off the Chains → Wet Work → Willing Captives / Intercepting the Orb → Liberating Apatia\nNote that, provided you press ESC instead of clicking on the close dialogue option (\"Thank you, Pale Tree. I will remember your wisdom.\"), then you may talk to the Pale Tree again to change your response. Your response is submitted when you click on the  button and the final cutscene will then start.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nZojja\nCharr\nMaakel the Immortal\nRytlock Brimstone\nGhost\nThe Last King of Orr\nHuman\nJinx Lockwood\nKaden Warner\nLogan Thackeray\nMaklain the Minstrel\nNorn\nEthil Keenear\nEir Stegalkin\nGarm\nGeertruyde the Steadfast\nRisen\nRisen Abomination\nRisen Acolyte\nRisen Corrupter\nRisen Despoiler\nRisen Noble\nRisen Plaguebearer\nRisen Preserver\nRisen Putrifier\nRisen Ravager\nRisen Servant\nRisen Subjugator\nRisen Wizard\nVeteran Risen Giant\nSylvari\nAvatar of the Tree\nCaithe\nCeleste\nFaolain\nKrys\nTrahearne\nVarious\nPriory Explorer\nSylvan Hound\nPriory Historian\nPriory Scribe\nRaider\nRaider Guard\nVigil Crusader\nVigil Marksman\nVigil Tactician\nWhispers Agent\nWhispers Lightbringer\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nRisen\nEye of Zhaitan\nGate Guardian\nOrrian Spectral Guard\nOrrian Spectral Juggernaut\nRisen Abomination\nRisen Brute\nRisen Bull\nRisen Chicken\nRisen Grub\nRisen Thrall\nVeteran Risen Giant\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\n\n=== In the Omphalos Chamber ===\nApproaching Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: Hail, Mother.

Zhaitan is attacking in force.\nAvatar of the Tree: The soul of Tyria mourned as her children were cut down by the beast. The land wept, and the world shuddered.\nTrahearne: My friend and I seek to right that wrong. We wish to fight Zhaitan, and take back what was lost. We've to [sic] come to ask your counsel.\nAvatar of the Tree: The answer is at the heart of Tyria's future—and your own. Both of you must face the darkness, become guiding stars in the night.\n<Character name>: Is it even possible to defeat Zhaitan?\nAvatar of the Tree: Only with great courage. Come. I will show you a vision of your future, and the challenges to come...\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: It is time, my brave friends. Your future... awaits.\nTalking to Avatar of the Tree:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: You must soon enter the vision, and gain a glimpse of what may be.\n What do you mean, \"vision\"?\nThe portal before you is a passage into the Dream. There, you will see glimpses of the past, the present, and the future.\n(if sylvari)\n Is this like the time you sent Caithe into the Dream, before I awakened?\nRemember, this is very difficult for me. Go swiftly, and learn all you can.\n I have another question.\n I will make haste, Mother. Thank you.\n(if not sylvari)\n What is the Dream? I don't understand.\nThe Dream is the sylvari unconscious, the wellspring from which we flow. It holds our memories, as well as our hopes and fears. I am its keeper.\n I have another question.\n I understand. I'll enter the vision now.\n What will I see if I go through the portal?\nOrr as it is, and was—and some sense of how you may restore it, I hope. Scenes of the past that impact your future.\n Will I be in danger?\nLife always holds danger, <Character name>. Show courage and you will persevere.\n I have another question.\n I'll do my best to learn all I can.\n Will you and Trahearne come with me?\nTrahearne will accompany you, and I will be with you in spirit.\n I have another question.\n I will do my best.\n(if not sylvari)\n Excuse me, but who are you?\nI am the avatar, the spirit of the Pale Tree that surrounds you. I am the mother of the sylvari race. I am Tyria's ally.\n I have another question.\n I'll trust you.\n I'll do that. Thank you.\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: The Pale Tree wishes us to enter the Dream! It is a dangerous honor.\n What do you mean?\nThe Dream is not reality, <Character name>. It is made of memory, aether, and powerful magic. Even I do not understand it.\n How is that dangerous?\nThe things within are as real as you or I [sic], and they will seek to do us harm. I question if I am ready to see such truths.\n I'll be with you.\nI will remember that, <Character name>. Thank you.\n Let's not keep the Pale Tree waiting any longer.\nInteracting with the portal back to the Grove:\n\nUnknown: You are about to leave the story area.\n Return to the Grove. (Warning: Your story here is not yet finished. All progress will be abandoned if you leave the area.)\n Cancel.\n\n\n=== The Pale Tree's vision of Orr ===\nAfter stepping through the portal into the Pale Tree's vision:\n\nTrahearne: Orr is a dark and foul place. Even though I have been here, in truth this vision is unsettling.\nTrahearne: Let us hurry. The Pale Tree has lessons yet to be revealed.\nTalking to Trahearne:\n\nTrahearne: Hurry, <Character name>. The Mother Tree cannot maintain this shard of the Dream for very long. We must press onward.\n Is this truly what Orr is like?\nI have studied Orr for many years, and I know these paths as if they were of the Caledon.\n I have another question.\n I'll trust your knowledge.\n Where is Zhaitan?\nZhaitan commands his minions from the blasphemed and tarnished city of Arah, far to the south.\n I have another question.\n Someday, we'll go there and end this.\n Let's keep moving\nFollowing the Pale Tree's Avatar through the vision:\n\nTrahearne: They say that Orr was once beautiful. A nation to rival Kryta, Ascalon, and Elona.\nTrahearne: The human gods lived in the city of Arah, and the people here were blessed.\nTrahearne: After the gods left, the humans banded into guilds and warred upon each other.\nTrahearne: The Guild Wars caused great devastation, and the nations faltered.\nTrahearne: Where does this road lead, Mother?\nAvatar of the Tree: To the ancient city of Arah, the dragon's stronghold.\nAvatar of the Tree: That is your goal. Along the way, you will glimpse things that may yet come to pass.\nTrahearne: These creatures are formidable. Tougher than the ones at Claw Island. How will we defeat them?\nAvatar of the Tree: Alone, you cannot. But with unity, you will find that many impossible things can be achieved.\nComing upon the ghostly fighters of the Durmand Priory, Order of Whispers and Vigil:\n\nVision Trahearne: Defenders of Tyria!\nVision Trahearne: When Zhaitan rose from slumber, the dragon found a long-dead nation and claimed it.\nVision Trahearne: The dragon expected the rest of Tyria to be as easily conquered. But we live, and we breathe, and we fight!\nVision Trahearne: All races, all orders, and all paths of life stand against Zhaitan.\nVision Trahearne: The dragon is a fearsome enemy. It wants nothing more than to paralyze us with doubt.\nVision Trahearne: But I tell you this—we are not afraid! We will never kneel!\nVision Trahearne: Do you feel that? The dragon hears us!\nVision Trahearne: To Arah, and victory!\nTrahearne: Is this a vision of the future? Mother, I do not understand. I'm no general.\nAvatar of the Tree: You must be what Tyria needs you to be, my son. You have more courage than you realize.\nBefore coming upon ghostly shadows of Destiny's Edge:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: The past taints the future. Our heroes have fallen. They must be redeemed.\nAvatar of the Tree: You are the catalyst. You must bring them together. Heal their wounds.\nNear the vision of Rytlock and Logan:\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Where were you? We needed you! Snaff...I couldn't protect him. I can still hear him screaming.\nLogan Thackeray: Someone was going to die, no matter what I did—Snaff, or my queen. I had to make a choice.\nLogan Thackeray: You would have done the same, any of you, if the person you loved was in danger! You would have done the same...\nTrahearne: Destiny's Edge disbanded after their loss against the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik. To this day, they have unresolved grievances with one another.\nNear the vision of Zojja and Eir:\n\nZojja: It was your responsibility. Snaff trusted you, and you failed him!\nEir Stegalkin: I tried to keep him out out [sic] of danger. I would have given anything to prevent his death!\nZojja: It wasn't enough. You weren't enough. You should have died, Eir, instead of him...\nTrahearne: Logan was called away by his queen, yet Eir chose to fight the Elder Dragon. They lost. Glint died, along with Snaff, Zojja's mentor and friend.\nNear the vision of Caithe and Faolain:\n\nCaithe: I've tried so very hard. They can't stop arguing. They can't understand that the dragons are more important.\nCaithe: They'd throw everything away! I'm alone—and I'm tired.\nFaolain: Come back to me. If the world must end, let us spend our last days in each other's arms.\nTrahearne These visions represent a possible future for Destiny's Edge should they not resolve their quarrels. We need them to reconcile if we're to defeat Zhaitan.\nTalking to Faolain:\n\nFaolain: Walk away, <Character name>. Caithe is to be with me, ever after.\n Who are you?\nI was never part of their worthless little gang. I am the Grand Duchess of the Nightmare Court. She is mine, and I am hers.\n You're nothing but a vision of Caithe's lover.\n I won't let Caithe fall into nightmare.\nAfter passing all of Destiny's Edge:\n\nTrahearne: Where was I? Oh, yes. The Guild Wars. Still angry over the loss of Ascalon, the charr struck hard while humanity fought with itself.\nTrahearne: The charr ravaged Ascalon with searing cauldrons and marched on Orr.\nTrahearne: As hope failed, an Orrian named Vizier Khilbron read the Lost Scrolls and unleashed an ancient curse.\nTrahearne: The curse annihilated the charr army, but it destroyed Orr as well. A cataclysm plunged the nation into the ocean. Everything was lost.\nAt Azabe Qabar, the Royal Tombs:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: This is the tomb of the kings of Orr. Walk inside, and seek truth.\nAvatar of the Tree: But be warned—the future can change in the blink of an eye...\nSpeaking with the Last King of Orr before defeating the Eye of Zhaitan:\n\nThe Last King of Orr: We will speak, once you have proven your worth against these wretches.\nTalking to the Last King of Orr (cinematic):\n\nThe Last King of Orr: To see the sky...feel once more the wind, and the sun...although my nation has drowned, a slow blood still pulses in its veins.\nThe Last King of Orr: Orr was once the heart of Tyria, so full of life. I was the last of a line of proud rulers. Now, my nation is enslaved.\nThe Last King of Orr: What do you seek here? Orr has nothing left to give, save ash and bones.\n<Character name>: We came to fight Zhaitan. Can you give us counsel?\nThe Last King of Orr: Zhaitan can be defeated, but that will not save Orr. The land must be cleansed of this poison. Seek the source...\n<Character name>: Is Zhaitan the source, or is there some other poison that fouls Orr? Please, tell us!\nThe Last King of Orr: Seek the source...Cleanse Orr...Seek...the source...\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nTrahearne: It was Zhaitan, the Elder Undead Dragon, that pulled Orr from the depths.\nTrahearne: The massacre of Orr gave the dragon fertile ground to create its horrific army.\nTrahearne: Zhaitan's power does not end here. In slaughter, its army grows stronger. Claw Island was just the beginning.\nTrahearne: The dragons are destruction. They will not stop until all life on Tyria is destroyed.\nBefore confronting the Guardian of the Gate:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Your last challenge on the road to Arah will be the guardian of the gate. Beyond this...I cannot foretell.\nAvatar of the Tree: Once before, I gave this sword to a beloved son. Now, I pass it on to you, Trahearne.\nAvatar of the Tree: Its name is Caladbolg. Bear it with honor, and the sword will never fail you.\nAvatar of the Tree: Test yourselves against the guardian, then return to me in the Grove.\n\n\n=== Back in the Omphalos Chamber ===\nAvatar of the Tree: Once more, you stand on sacred ground. Remember what you have seen. Speak with me, and I will guide you.\nTalking to Trahearne before talking to Avatar of the Tree:\n\nTrahearne: I am newly inspired...yet I feel as if the burden of my Wyld Hunt is growing even heavier.\n What troubles you about it? (if sylvari)\nI must see Orr green again. But how? Can you say you looked upon that place and saw a blossoming future? Truly?\n The vision wasn't about certainties. It was about hope.\n Your Wyld Hunt? (if non-sylvari)\nI am tasked by the Dream to cleanse Orr, so that it may grow and thrive once more. It's an impossible task.\n That doesn't mean we shouldn't try.\nTalking to the Avatar of the Tree:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Orr has had all hope stripped from it. To confront the dragon you must first overcome your greatest fear, lest you be consumed by it. Tell me, what do you fear, <Character name>?\n That an innocent person who believed in me would die because I couldn't save them. (Let an innocent die story)\nYou are a good person, <Character name>. That you seek to protect the innocent shows your gentle heart. Hold fast to that earnestness; it will also be your strength.\n Thank you, Pale Tree. I will remember your wisdom.\n That I would fail so grievously that I would lose the respect of my comrades and be dishonored. (Dishonor my allies story)\nIt is good to hold friends in high regard, but better to live up to your own high ideals. Keep this in mind, if you find yourself alone.\n Thank you, Pale Tree. I will remember your wisdom.\n That one day through my actions I'd condemn someone to suffer in agony. (Make another suffer story)\nYour heart is courageous but also kind. Hold fast to that, <Character name>, and remember that mistakes can be repaired, if you are strong enough to face them.\n Thank you, Pale Tree. I will remember your wisdom.\n I need some time to consider my answer, Mother Tree.\nCinematic after talking to Avatar of the Tree:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: To know the future, even the mere possibility, can be a great burden. I am sorry, brave heroes, that you must walk this path.\nTrahearne: Must these things come to pass, Mother? Must I take up Caladbolg and travel into the heart of Orr?\nAvatar of the Tree: You must both take up this mantle. Trahearne, your duty is to cleanse Orr. Your friend shall aid you...and then face the dragon.\n<Character name>: And Claw Island? Can we retake it and save Lion's Arch?\nAvatar of the Tree: I believe so...but that will not be your first test. The dragon seeks to destroy its enemies before they can strike.\nAvatar of the Tree: I see within the Dream that Zhaitan's forces enter battle—not against Lion's Arch, but at the heart of your Order.\n<Character name>: My order headquarters? No! How could that be? How could Zhaitan even know...\nAvatar of the Tree: Those who have been corrupted reveal everything to Zhaitan. Nothing is secret, least of all those places where his enemies hide.\n<Character name>: If my friends are in danger, I have to go to them. They have no warning—they'll be slaughtered!\nTrahearne: I will go with you. Our fates are bound together, and from this day forward, we fight as one.\nAvatar of the Tree: Farewell, valiant souls. May your Wyld Hunt be successful, and may your courage illuminate the dark of night.\nTalking to Avatar of the Tree after the cinematic:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: I hope that the visions you saw will be of benefit.\n Was I really in Orr?\nYou were within a dream of Orr, composed of memories, fears, and hopes. Hope that one day Zhaitan will be destroyed.\n I have another question.\n I have a lot to think about. Excuse me.\n Will the things I saw come to pass?\nThey are possibilities, <Character name>. May you find the strength and spirit to craft the future of Tyria, and discover the salvation of Orr.\n I have another question.\n That is a heavy burden. I will do my best.\n I will use this knowledge to aid us.\nTalking to Trahearne after the cinematic:\n\nTrahearne: Our friends among your Order are in danger. We must act, <Character name>!\n Let's go.\nInteracting with the portal back to the Grove:\n\nUnknown: You are about to leave the story area.\n Return to the Grove.\n Cancel.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nAfter defeating the Gate Guardian, if you die in the Grove (by falling from the Omphalos Chamber) and pick the return to checkpoint option, then you will return to the dream of Orr.\nMechanically, this takes place in a copy of Orr that's located between The Grove and Rata Sum and belongs to the Maguuma Jungle. This can be observed by switching levels on the world map or by placing a personal waypoint. However, it is still possible to uncover the Gates of Arah Point of Interest.\nVisually, the vision shows the landscape of a section of the Cursed Shore open world area of Orr; the specific regions of Cursed Shore shown in the vision are Azabe Qabar, the Royal Tombs, Craven Blight, Compass Plaza, and the Promenade of the Gods.\nTwo copies of Krys, Celeste, Kaden Warner and Jinx Lockwood can be observed in the same encampment south of Craven Blight. While the copies of Krys, Celeste and Kaden Warner only differ in their looks, Jinx Lockwood appears as a human (standing outside the gate, on the way in) and an asura (standing inside the encampment).\n\n\n=== Dialogue changes ===\nWhen the Personal story was restored to its original form in the June 23, 2015 update, this mission underwent significant dialogue alteration for clarity and brevity. The above dialogue is accurate to the current version of the game, the below shows original dialogue that was cut or replaced.",

      "strWikiText": "Party Politics is the first story episode in the The Dragon's Reach: Part 2 chapter of Living World Season 2.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nCheck your mail for \"Ministry Treachery.\"\n\nCheck your mail.\nExonerate Queen Jennah so she can attend the summit.\n\nMeet with Kasmeer.\nGet introduced at the party.\nFind the lying minister without arousing suspicion.\nTalk to Kasmeer.\nSpeak with Minister Arton.\nGather incriminating evidence against the lying minister.\nTalk to Kasmeer.\nConfront the lying minister.\nReject the minister's revised statement.\nDisprove the minister's final statement.\nDiscuss Anise with Kasmeer.\nSpeak with Anise.\nUse Anise's evidence to silence the lying minister.\nWitness Anise and Kasmeer's wrap-up conversation.\nSpeak with Anise.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n  Chaos Orb\n  Dusty Bag of Loot (3)\n  Tiny Bag of Geodes\n  Embroidered Coin Purse\n  Empyreal Fragment (5)\n\n\n== Event ==\n Avoid suspicious activity among the party guests (80)\nSuspicion\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nNote: this is to complete the instance with no suspicion, but it is not required to do it this way to complete it.\nAfter reading your mail, head to Balthazar Low Road in Divinity's Reach to start the instance. Listen to Kasmeer then head towards the green star and speak to the Herald to be introduced to the party and meet Countess Anise.\nYou then need to find the person who has been spreading rumors about Queen Jennah without raising suspicion too much. Accusing the wrong person, or accusing them without enough proof will raise suspicion.\nThere are three party guests you need to talk to, each marked on the map with a green circle which will change to a green star overhead once you have come close enough to trigger their first line of dialogue. If you pick the wrong questions, you will raise suspicion and get no information; on the other hand, if you pick the right one, Kasmeer will comment on it, and the quest will advance. Note that it is possible to pick the wrong options several times, raising the suspicion level each time (see achievements below).\nMoving from west to east the three guests are:\n\nNear Minister Estelle, a male noble will say \"What? Minister Estelle is being pressured by Minister Merula to retire? She would never! She's far too ambitious.\"\nSpeak to him and choose \"Wait. I wanted to ask you something\"\nand then \"Is that why Minister Estelle wants to retire? A lack of excitement?\" before the timer runs out.\nA nobleman with a feathered hat on the path to the food tables says \"But I thought for certain it was Minister Wi who attended court the day Scarlet was there. Are you sure?\".\nSpeak to him and choose \"I was expecting to see Minister Wi's wife here today.\"\nthen the second option \"(laugh) If you've seen one minister, you've seen them all.\"\nA noblewoman to the right of Minister Wi says \"I wish Anise hadn't invited the ministers. They make me so uncomfortable! Especially Minister- excuse me! Are you eavesdropping?\" as you approach.\nYou'll have to talk to her until Kasmeer asks you to try again (at first you need to ask if she's enjoying the party, after that there is only 1 option at a time),\nthen pick \"I wouldn't think anyone could ignore such a beautiful night as this\"\nand then \"I hear one minister is spreading rumours about the queen\".\nOnce you have gathered all the information talk to Kasmeer, then to Minister Arton, who is standing near Countess Anise at the center of the party and is marked with a green star once this step starts. After that conversation, you'll need to find evidence against the culprit: Minister Estelle. Again, you'll need to talk to three people, each of whom is marked by a green circle on the map which changes to a star once you get close to them:\n\nLady Claire. Her dialogue will start after speaking to Minister Arton, standing beside her.\nChoose \"That's just a bad rumor, a lie\"\nthen \"This doesn't add up.\"\nA noble standing near Countess Anise.\nChoose \"That may be complicated.\"\nthen \"You don't think she met with Scarlet?\"\nA servant standing near Minister Estelle.\nYou need to choose \"I've had some experience with ministers. Not all are bad\"\nthen \"Do you like your jobs?\".\nOnce you've spoken to all three talk to Kasmeer (who will remind you of the information you've obtained), then speak to Minister Estelle.\nFirst pick \"I know all about you.\"\nthen \"I have a question. Is it true that you work closely with Minister Caudecus?\"\nthen \"Tell me more.\" several times, until the option to say \"Kasmeer, what do you think?\" appears.\nChoose \"Tell me more.\" (second option) twice more, until the option \"Shy, huh?\" (first option) appears.\nSpeak to Minister Estelle again. Be aware that this conversation has a time limit, you need to pick the correct option before the timer runs out.\nStart with \"Did you hear what the queen discussed with Scarlet?\".\nAs before choose \"Tell me more.\" until \"Kasmeer, what do you think?\" appears.\nThen choose \"Tell me more.\" until you can say \"I heard the queen was escorted out for her safety.\"\nSpeak to Minister Estelle again.\nStart with \"You're sticking by the claim that they arranged this in the throne room?\"\nthen click \"Tell me more\" until the option \"Minister Estelle can you repeat that?\" appears. Do not ask Kasmeer for her opinion, instead ask Minister Estelle to repeat herself (first option).\nContinue clicking \"Tell me more.\" until the option \"You told your accomplice to say it was a black cape.\" appears, then choose that option.\nFollow Kasmeer, speak to her and then head towards the green star on the map to speak to Countess Anise. As you get close the star will disappear and a green circle will appear. Walk into it to reveal the REAL Countess Anise. Listen to the dialogue between her and Kasmeer then return to Minister Estelle. This time there will be only one dialogue option at a time. Listen to Kasmeer and Anise then speak to Anise to complete the instance.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nThese achievements are mutually exclusive.\n\nTo get this achievement, you must never raise suspicion. Since the steps that don't raise suspicions are the ones necessary to progress the story, you can just use the guide above to look at the correct answers in every conversation.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Sneaky Sleuth effect.\n\nThis achievement requires you to only select a dialogue option with the icon  a total of twelve times. This involves the same process as Sneaky Sleuth, with one exception: you have to skip the interrogation of the first three nobles, by directly talking to Minister Estelle and accusing her instead.\nSince this raises suspicion, you'll have to do the instance twice to get both this and the Sneaky Sleuth achievement.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Super Sleuth effect.\n\nRaising the suspicion to full is not necessary, since a full gauge will get you thrown out. Instead, you must be right under that threshold. For instance, you may go talk to the nobleman in the feathered hat and pick option 3 (\"If he was, then he's probably involved in these nasty lies about the queen\") four times, then option 1 (\"Were You attending Court that day?\") once. Once the suspicion level is raised high enough, complete the instance as you did for Sneaky Sleuth and you'll get the achievement.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Shoddy Sleuth effect.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nHuman\nKasmeer Meade\nCountess Anise\nCanach\nMinister Nitalie\nMinister Merula\nMinister Estelle\nMinister Wi\nMinister Arton\nLady Claire\nLord Faren\nHerald\nSeraph Soldier\nMinistry Guard\nNoble\nCaterer\nHead Caterer\nServant\nFeline\nChauncey von Snuffles III\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\nEntering the instance\nKasmeer Meade: Let me catch you up on what's happening.\nKasmeer Meade: Queen Jennah can't attend the summit because someone has accused her of conspiring with Scarlet. The hearing is the same day.\nKasmeer Meade: Someone's lying, and we have to figure out who.\nKasmeer Meade: Soon as we know, we can confront that person and get them to recant their statement.\nKasmeer Meade: We need to talk to everyone, find clues to the truth, and build evidence to defend the queen. Once we discover who among them is the mastermind, we'll take action.\nKasmeer Meade: But be careful. The people are suspicious and sensitive. Say something too blunt or off-putting, and they'll clam up.\nKasmeer Meade: If we're obviously undermining their plans, they'll have us escorted out of the party, and it will all have been for nothing.\nTalking to Kasmeer\nThey'll introduce us at the steps.\n All right. Let's go.\nApproaching the Herald\nHerald: Ahem. Introducing a hero who needs no introduction, the Commander of the Pact.\nHerald: And accompanying, the La—ah, ahem, yes, Kasmeer Meade.\nKasmeer Meade: (exhale) Keep it together, Kas. You can get through this. Be confident, like Jory.\nCountess Anise: Kasmeer! Come over here. Don't look so glum.\nCountess Anise: Hello, dear Kasmeer. Don't worry your little face over what the herald's papers say. You'll always be noble in my eyes.\nKasmeer Meade: Countess Anise. That's direct...and kind of you to say. I'm afraid I don't feel particularly noble.\nCountess Anise: Then we must do something about that! Nobility isn't in the blood, as so many believe. It's in your choices.\nCountess Anise: Your return to grace is only a pardon away. If your talent for detecting lies is all you say it is...\nCountess Anise: Well, let's just say I'm confident we can convince the queen your value overrides your father's misfortune.\nKasmeer Meade: I only hope to be of some small service, Countess.\nKasmeer Meade: Oh dear. Okay. Let's start picking apart everything they say. One of these ministers is spreading lies about the queen.\nCanach: Don't misunderstand, Countess—I'm certainly grateful to you for purchasing my billet and putting me to work.\nCanach: I'm just not sure I understand the reasoning behind dragging me to this soiree of yours.\nCountess Anise: Mm?\nCanach: (sigh)\nTalking to Kasmeer\nI think you should take the lead, and I'll shadow you. People will be far more likely to talk to you than me. We can touch base occasionally, and I'll tell you what I've observed.\n Remind me what we're doing here, please.\nWelcome to the politics of Divinity's Reach. I'm sorry to drag you into this, but I will be more successful with you at my side. I'm still something of a pariah in noble society here.\n You said something about a rumor?\nYes, it's ridiculous. Someone's saying they witnessed the queen meet privately with Scarlet late at night. Under a bridge of all things.\n Do they have proof?\nThey don't need it. They say they overheard Queen Jennah offer support for Scarlet's research and the blueprints to the Watchknights.\n All they have to do is hurt her reputation and sow doubt.\nYes. It undermines her leadership. She can't leave until this is settled.\n Why not?\nThe ministers behind it will take advantage of her absence to turn people against her. They're always trying to take power from her. She has to be constantly vigilant.\n So, if we find the person spreading the rumors, we defuse the situation?\nWe have to do more than find the person. We have to discredit them.\n How do we do that?\nThe old-fashioned-way: eavesdropping and rumor-mongering. We'll gather information at the party then sort through it for the bits that lead to the culprit. You mingle, and I'll watch for liars.\n You'll watch for liars?\nMy ability seems to be getting stronger. I don't know what it is, but I can sometimes tell if a person is lying. Especially if they're not very good at lying or if the lie is especially flagrant.\n Stay close then. Let's go.\n Count on me.\nTalking to Countess Anise\nEnjoy the party. Please feel free to mingle and introduce yourself. Excuse me, I...\n I see you're busy. We'll talk later.\nTalking to Canach\nCareful there. You don't want to be seen getting too friendly with the staff.\n Why are you here?\nI'm on the job. Bodyguard for a countess. A somewhat more glamorous position than my last, I must say.\n You mean your position as...prisoner?\nYes, and thanks for stating the obvious, painful truth. Technically, I'm still a prisoner. It's just now my bars are lined with velvet. Don't let that fool you though. I'm definitely not free.\n The countess owns you now?\nThat's harsh. I wouldn't say that. More like I'm on loan to her from the prison. So long as I'm a good grunt, she'll keep me with her and I don't have to go back in the cell.\n You planning on behaving yourself?\nAbsolutely. I'm no fool. I could be in a much worse situation than this. I guess you could say I learned my lesson. I know I have a reputation for acting rashly, but those days are behind me.\n Pardon me if I don't entirely believe you.\nNo pardon necessary. You're in a crowd of many watching me like hawks. So far, Countess Anise has treated me with respect. I have no reason to betray her trust. Besides, she amuses me mightily.\n I'll be at the front of the hunting party if you mess this up.\nI would expect no less, though I do believe you might have a hard time catching me again. No offense intended.\n Just watch yourself.\nTalking to Minister Arton\nAs I was telling my old friend Caudecus the other day, we really must do something about these bandits. They are a hazard. I have reason to believe they're connected to the White Mantle.\n You can't distract me from seeing you're the one lying about the queen. *\n(laugh) You're as blunt as they say. We should share a bottle sometime. Unfortunately, in this case, you're wrong. My servants will vouch that I was home all evening the night of the bridge meeting.\nWell, I will be speaking to your servant to verify your statement. *\nDo that. But since you'd take my servants' words over my own, I have nothing more to say to you.\nVery well. I'll be off then.\nObviously, I must continue my investigation elsewhere.\n But the White Mantle have been gone for ages.\nThey're certainly no longer the force they were a couple hundred years ago, but I've seen their symbol in unexpected places. I believe they run the black market around here.\n That's an interesting theory.\n Excuse me, I must mingle.\nApproaching Lord Faren\nNoble: Oh, no. Avoid anything remotely equestrian. You don't want your guests to enter your foyer and think the balusters are centaurs.\nTalking to Lord Faren\nWell, you fancy up nicely when you knock the dirt off your boots. Although, the tough-adventurer look suits you. Mind, beware the ministers. They're on the prowl.\n Why can't the ministers and the nobles get along?\nHumans. What can I say? We're an inscrutable race. Turn half the world against us, and we still find ways to argue among ourselves. Frankly, I think it's boredom that makes us do it.\n Where do you fit in?\nMe? Oh, I'm just here for the delicious desserts and ladies. I'm eyeing a few of both, but I can't quite decide which I'm hungry for.\n Choose wisely. Too much of either can give you a bellyache.\nTruer words were never spoken. Have a good time at the party.\n I will. Thank you.\nTalking to Minister Merula\nDo you think Faren would date a minister? Just saying it sounds scandalous, but I love a good scandal. How romantic it would be!\n Aha! You're the one spreading lies about Queen Jennah! *\nHow dare you accuse me of such a distasteful crime! Can you even back up your accusation, or are you just blowing hot air in the Ministry's face?\nOops, I must be mistaken. Just trying to help the queen out, y'know? ^\nWell...I suppose you were just doing your part. But think before you blab next time!\nWill do.\nBut you like scandals! *\nIf you keep this up, I'll make sure you're at the center of one!\nOkay, I'm leaving.\nI, um...good-bye.\n You're a fan of Faren, huh?\nOh, yes! I know all his favorite restaurants, venues, and shops. I even have the coveted Faren wall calendar of 1324 AE!\n Scandalous, indeed.\n I don't understand you people.\nTalking to Minister Nitalie\nI hate parties. Sadly, public appearances are part of a minister's job.\n I bet you would rather be at home plotting against the queen! *\n(cough) What's this nonsense you're spewing? Oh, you've made me spill wine on my shirt. It's a Zommoros original! I'll have you arrested for this.\nNever mind. You're more worried about your clothes than your reputation. ^\nGuar_ Gaurds... Gaww... (sob) Go away!\nAll right. Good-bye.\nWhat? No! It looks so much better this way. *\nNo, it doesn't! It looks like a big, ugly wine stain! (sob) Oh no, now my mascara's dripping onto it, too. Guards!\nUh-oh.\nI'd better go.\n They have their merits—the food, for example.\nAnd the punch. Have you tried it? Hmm, you're the first decent person I've met here. Say, if you're not busy later...\n Nope! I'm, uh, busy mingling. With others. All night. 'Bye.\n Just smile and nod. Works wonders.\nApproaching the group of three nobles near Minister Merula\nNoble: Stop right there. I don't care about your dog's new haircut.\nTalking to that nobleman\n(gasp) Six above! Such style, such class! I simply must know who does your hair.\n(If charr)\n I self-groom.\n(Otherwise)\n I just get a lot of sun.\nReally? I must look into this right away. Come fall, I wouldn't be surprised if Divinity's Reach citizens were all flaunting your style!\n That would be...interesting.\n Myself.\nReally? I must look into this right away. Come fall, I wouldn't be surprised if Divinity's Reach citizens were all flaunting your style!\n That would be...interesting.\n I was born this way.\nApproaching a couple of nobles\nNoble: This shrimp bisque is fantastic! I need another bowl.\nTalking to Minister Estelle\nYou're a busy bee. Does that make you charming, or does it make you nosy?\n Definitely nosy. They say you were in court the same day Scarlet was.\nIt's a matter of public record who receives an audience with the queen and when. There were several people there that day.\n What did Scarlet want?\nShe was soft spoken. I doubt anyone heard her but the queen and Countess Anise. It was as if they were conspiring.\n Did you see Minister Arton there?\nI believe so. I spent most of the time behind my handkerchief. The goat—or maybe it was the farmer—smelled so badly it made my eyes water.\n I see.\n Charming, I hope. Did you know I dealt the killing blow to Scarlet?\nNo! That was you? I saw her once, in the throne room. She was having a quiet talk with the queen.\n Lucky you.\nBut why is someone of your caliber walking around the party with Kasmeer Meade? Her family is a bunch of criminals and gamblers!\n You should perhaps keep your thoughts to yourself.\nI believe you should mingle so others can bask in your glory.\n Great idea.\n She's my friend. Show her respect, or I'll teach you some.\nI believe you should mingle so others can bask in your glory.\n Great idea.\n You're an idiot.\nI believe you should mingle so others can bask in your glory.\n Great idea.\n That's for me to know and you to find out.\nApproaching the nobles to the right of Minister Estelle\nNoble: I see Minister Estelle has political ambitions. She's been having a lot of private meetings with Minister Caudecus.\nApproaching the nobles to the left of Minister Estelle\nNoble: What? Minister Estelle is being pressured by Minister Merula to retire? She would never! She's far too ambitious.\nTalking to the latter nobleman\nI'm going to get more punch. It's so fruity!\n Wait. I wanted to ask you something.\nOnly if you make it quick! I'm so excited!\n I'd think that spreading rumors about the queen would prove very exciting. *\nIf I may, I suggest you reconsider saying such things at a party.\nPerhaps you're right.\n Two-faced liar... I doubt you truly appreciate the hospitality. *\nMy goodness! That's rather rude. I've suddenly lost my taste for food or drink.\nI believe I should mingle. Enjoy the party.\n Is that why Minister Estelle wants to retire? A lack of excitement?\nUndoubtedly. She likes to be in the thick of things, but Caudecus has had her doing clerical work lately. She meets with him regularly, from what I've heard. He'll talk her out of retiring, I'm sure.\n Undoubtedly. Enjoy the party.\n The queen throws a good party.\nOh, this isn't the queen's work. This is all Countess Anise. She is amazing. She can charm cream straight out of a cow. She's a mesmer, after all.\n Excellent point.\n Just passing by. You should also try the shrimp.\nAfter selecting the third question\nKasmeer Meade: I've never met Minister Estelle. If she's been meeting with Caudecus, she may know something.\nWhen walking near Canach and Anise\nCanach: Am I to intimidate these ministers and aristocrats, to put them off guard?\nCanach: Surely you can't imagine that these dandies pose some kind of threat to you.\nCountess Anise: Hm?\nCanach: Are you even paying attention or do you simply not care? Either way, you are a maddening woman.\nApproaching the nobleman with a feathered hat at the bottom of the stairs near Minister Wi\nNoble: But I thought for certain it was Minister Wi who attended the court the day Scarlet was there. Are you sure?\nTalking to him\nI have a vague recollection of that crazy sylvari walking in to her audience with the queen. This was well before the attack on the city, by the way. I still don't know why I noticed her.\n I was expecting to see Minister Wi's wife here today.\nLady Wi? She gets the vapors. Fragile constitution. Poor dear can't keep up with her husband. Apparently neither can I. I thought he was in court the day Scarlet had an audience with the queen.\n Were YOU attending the court that day?\nNo. I was in the foyer. I saw them enter. They weren't many in attendance that day. I remember seeing a farmer with a complaint against his neighbor. He'd brought his goat along.\n Interesting. What about...\n Good day to you.\n (laugh) If you've seen one minister, you've seen them all.\n(laugh) It's the dour look on their face. But seriously, it is rather difficult to confuse Minister Wi with Minister Estelle or even Minister Arton. My memory just isn't what it used to be.\n Which one did you confuse with Minister Wi? (laugh)\nI saw Estelle enter the throne room, along with the goat farmer, Minister Arton, and a sylvari. That wretch turned out to be Scarlet, she did.\n Nice talking to you.\n If he was, then he's probably involved in these nasty lies about the queen.\nI happen to like Minister Wi. I don't think you should disparage his reputation like that.\n Interesting. What about...\n I meant no offense.\n Yeah. Sooo. Do you like gardening?\nGardening! What a lovely pastime. The wife and I indulge ourselves with a little gardening from time to time, especially in our rose garden—\n If you like gardens, you should see the Beetlestone gardens.\nOh, I have. My wife—she's a minister—and I were just out there last week for a small garden party. An intimate affair, it was only us, Estelle, Arton, and Lord Caudecus. Lovely evening.\n What did you discuss?\nThe usual political gossip. Casual, you know. Estelle had a moment of private discussion with Lord Caudecus, though he did most of the talking, and she did quite a lot of nodding.\n That's nice.\n Good day.\nAfter selecting the second question\nKasmeer Meade: I remember hearing, afterward, that Scarlet approached the queen. No one paid any attention back then. Scarlet was a nobody until the Queen's Jubilee.\nApproaching a group of nobles at the bottom of the stairs near Minister Wi\nNoble: Ooh, wherever did you get that charming brooch, dear?\nApproaching Minister Wi\nNoble: And then he asked me which pair I wanted! To suggest I couldn't afford both—why, I should have slapped him on the spot!\nTalking to her\nHow Lady Anise persuaded Chauncey to grace her party, I'll never know! She's more resourceful than I thought. This is truly the classiest occasion I've attended since Lady Wi's clambake.\n Um, clambake?\nOh, mercy me, how confusing that must sound? Lady Wi had a little rebel in her, don't you know. She insisted we call her seafood banquet a clambake. (giggle) So edgy!\n Weird.\n Yep. Classy.\nApproaching Minister Wi\nMinister Wi: How I wish my lovely wife were here.\nTalking to Minister Wi\nIt really is a pity my wife had to miss the party. She just loves these sorts of things. But work is work.\n I understand. You keep up appearances while Lady Wi undermines the queen!\nPff, don't be ridiculous. Have you been at the punch? Take a moment to cool down, or you may offend someone less tolerant of your outrageous allegations.\n Okay, that was a stretch. I just want to help the queen.\n(sigh) Yes, yes, help the queen, help the world, help the everything. That's what you do, right? Just watch where you run that tongue. There are people here who wouldn't hesitate to cut it off.\n All right.\n You're avoiding the subject!\nI'll have you know my wife is at home with a nasty case of skritt itch. If it'll stop your badgering, I'll take you to see her. But I warn you, she's very contagious.\n I'll stick with the punch.\n Wait, there's punch? Excuse me.\n Have you heard that the queen is increasing taxes for land owners?\nWhat? I thought only workers paid taxes. Why ever would you tax land owners? That's ridiculous!\n It's just a rumor. Probably bad information.\n Take her a mini quiche, and she'll forgive you.\nApproaching the couple of nobles to the right of Minister Wi\nNoble: I wish Anise hadn't invited the ministers. They make me so uncomfortable! Especially Minister—excuse me! Are you eavesdropping?\nTalking to her\nYou do realize, I'm sure, that it's rude to eavesdrop. Were you?\n No, my lady. I merely wanted to introduce myself. I'm <Character name>.\nOh, I do beg your pardon. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Lady Allisin and my companion here is Lady Brinda.\n Are you enjoying the party?\nSome of the guests seem rather tense.\n A particular minister makes you uncomfortable? * (if Kasmeer has told the player to ask for more information)\nMinister Caudecus, of course. He surrounds himself with intrigue, cloaks, daggers, shadows—all that is nasty business. Don't let him look upon you, my dear. Once he has you in his sights, you're doomed.\n As you said, ministers can be dangerous.\n Thank you.\n I wouldn't think anyone could ignore such a beautiful night as this.\nOh, I'm quite sure some ministers prefer dark nights like this as sunny days. (laugh)\n I hear one minister is spreading rumors about the queen. (if Kasmeer has told the player to ask for more information)\nYes. Minister Caudecus is behind it, but he never involves himself directly. He has others do his dirty work. Like Estelle and Arton. They were awfully talkative with him at the last party.\n I understand.\n (laugh) That's true in my culture as well.\nI don't get out much, but I would like to visit where you're from. Tell me, how do you find our fair city?\n It's glorious. A real accomplishment. (before Kasmeer tells the player to ask for more information)\nKasmeer: She's not lying, but she's being evasive here. Try again, and press her for more information whenever she talks about the ministers::\n So, what were you saying about the party?\n How do the ministers get away with it? I'm curious. (if Kasmeer has told the player to ask for more information)\n I'm sorry. What were you saying? My mind drifted for a moment. (if Kasmeer has told the player to ask for more information)\n Kasmeer, did you spot anything out of order? (if Kasmeer has told the player to ask for more information)\nKasmeer: She's not lying, but she's being evasive here. Try again, and press her for more information whenever she talks about the ministers::\n So, what were you saying about the party?\n Ministers, ministers, ministers. (if Kasmeer has told the player to ask for more information)\n The pleasure is all mine. And what a fine evening it is.\nWe were just saying that we won't let anything spoil our fun. The countess throws wonderful parties, but these days, they're few and far between. Won't you regale us with tales of your adventures?\n Some other time, ladies.\n I'm happy to meet you both. Enjoy the party.\nAfter picking the second branch (\"I hear one minister is spreading rumors about the queen.\")\nKasmeer Meade: Of course. Caudecus would be involved in anything that undermines the queen. But he's not the one accusing her. We have to find that person.\nWalking by Canach and Anise after gathering more information\nCanach: You seem distracted, Countess. What are you looking for in this crowd?\nCanach: I could lend my eyes and ears to your search.\nCanach: If there's nothing in particular you need me to do, would you mind if I helped myself to some of your refreshments?\nCountess Anise: Hmph.\nCanach: Am I really so dull? Where, here's something interesting. Would you like to know how long a severed head remains conscious?\nCanach: I suppose not. Do let me know if you need me for more than make debutantes and fops uncomfortable.\nTalking to Kasmeer after talking to all three nobles\nMy mind is spinning. So much information! Can you make heads or tails of it?\n We've learned a few things. First, we know who was in court that day.\nYes! A farmer with a goat, two ministers—Estelle and Arton—and Scarlet.\n And, we know that Caudecus lets others do his dirty work for him.\nWe've also heard that both Estelle and Arton have seen Caudecus lately.\n It must be one of them. Let's talk to Minister Arton first.\nTalking to Minister Arton after talking to Kasmeer\nAs I was telling my old friend Caudecus the other day, we really must do something about these bandits. They are a hazard. I have reason to believe they're connected to the White Mantle.\n Did you see Scarlet the day she had an audience with the queen?\nI did. There were four of us in the throne room with the queen and Countess Anise—and the guards, of course. It was Scarlet, me, Minister Estelle, and some dirty farmer with a goat.\n And the queen spoke to Scarlet?\nYes. She was polite as always, but the countess kept whispering in the queen's ear. It was making us all nervous. Scarlet wanted permission to study with the engineer that designed the watchknights.\n What did the queen say?\nShe respectfully declined. Scarlet was the last in line, and the queen left before there could be any more discussion. Scarlet tried to say more, but the queen apologized and hurried out.\n Anything else?\nThe sylvari—Scarlet—looked livid. She stormed out, shoving guards out of her way. She was rather frightening, actually? I imagine that's what Countess Anise saw that made her hustle the queen away.\n Kas, does his testimony line up?\nKasmeer: His description of events perfectly matches what Anise told me. Minister Arton is telling the truth. He must not be the one.\n Interesting. Thank you.\nAfter talking to Arton\nKasmeer Meade: You've convinced me. It looks like Minister Estelle is the one spreading this horrible rumor.\nKasmeer Meade: Let's keep at it. If we're going to confront her, we'll need serious evidence to back us up.\nTalking to Kasmeer\nI don't much care for Minister Estelle. She has a brassiness to her. I'm not surprised she'd turn on the queen. Now, we have to find evidence to discredit her.\n Like before? Eavesdropping and rumormongering. \nYou're quite good at it. A natural, one might say. We still have to be careful because if they suspect we're working against the Ministry, they might stop talking to us.\n I'm read. Let's go.\nWalking near Lady Claire\nLady Claire: I know for a fact that the queen had a private talk with Scarlet. How? Everyone is saying it, so it must be true!\nTalking to Lady Claire\nHello. We were just discussing how horrible it is that the queen betrayed us all.\n That's just a bad rumor, a lie.\nNo, it's not. I saw her in the Salma district shortly after nightfall. She wore a black woolen cloak with the hood up. The only reason I knew it was her was because I bumped into her and saw her face.\n Hmm. If you say so.\nKasmeer: Hold on, <Character name>. Did you see her eye twitch? I don't think you should trust her.\n Kasmeer's right. I think you're lying.\n This doesn't add up.\nListen, just between you and me, I may not be telling the...exact...truth. But, they offered me a lot of gold if I'd say I was there. Please, you can't tell anyone.\n You're going to have to testify.\nOh, all right. I'll testify that I was paid to lie, but I'll never say who paid me. I don't betray old friends. Still, I wasn't comfortable lying, but my son is ill. I hope the queen will forgive me.\n You're doing the right thing.\n Kasmeer, what do you think?\nKasmeer: Her eye twitched when she said that. I don't think it's the truth.\n I believe you.\n You're lying. (same as \"This doesn't add up.\")\n It's a travesty.\nYou just never know who you can trust, do you? I feel bad for the queen, really. Looks like she got duped right along with the rest of us. That Scarlet was no good.\n Scarlet was evil.\n I'll leave you to it.\nAfter talking to Claire and calling her out\nKasmeer Meade: Good observation. I had a feeling she was lying. The queen wouldn't hold a private meeting with just anyone, much less a sylvari with no political connections. This woman will testify.\nWalking near the nobles close to Anise\nNoble: You must be mistaken. My niece knows from a guard who heard from a doorman that the queen—oh! I've said too much.\nTalking to her\nOf! You're...you! <Character name>. You're well known in these parts. The queen recently mentioned you were hosting a summit. She'd like very much to attend.\n That may be complicated.\nOh, I know. Those lies Estelle are spreading. Can you imagine our barefoot queen skulking through the streets at night, in disguise? It's laughable.\n You don't think she met with Scarlet?\nIn the throne room, yes. But not in the streets. A charr emissary visited the queen that night. While the emissary's since left, the guard who was present will testify.\n Good to know. Thanks.\n I can imagine it, actually. She's a mesmer. *\nYou're as silly as the liar. That night, Her Majesty didn't retire until late. She had a visitor, but it wasn't Scarlet. It was a charr emissary. They were working on the terms of the treaty.\n That's helpful. Thank you.\n Kasmeer, what do you think?\nLook at her breathing. It's even and calm. I believe she's telling the truth.\n So she didn't meet with Scarlet? (same as \"You don't think she met with Scarlet?\")\n But, mesmers use illusions to sneak around. * (same as \"I can imagine it, actually. She's a mesmer.\")\n It's my hope that she will.\nIt's about the Elder Dragons, isn't it. We all heard it roar. We live in fear that one of them will attack the city.\n I'll do my best to make sure that never happens.\n It's a pleasure to meet you.\nAfter realizing she's telling the truth\nKasmeer Meade: Countess Anise hardly ever lets the queen out of her sight. She and the guard will corroborate the queen's alibi.\nWalking near a servant close to Minister Estelle\nServant: Is lying a prerequisite for being in the ministry?\nTalking to the servant\nIt makes me so sad to think that the people who run our city, our kingdom, can't get along with each other. Now one of the ministers is spreading lies about the queen.\n I'll pay for any information you have on the lying minister. *\nThat's generous, but I have nothing to say. I'm employed by Minister Arton. I won't shoot myself in the foot for a few coins.\nUnderstood.\n I've had some experience with ministers. Not all are bad.\nBoth my wife and I work for ministers. They can be like night and day. My wife works for Minister Estelle. I work for Minister Arton.\n Do you like your job?\nMost days. My wife has a harder time. Her minister has a gambling problem. If she's winning, she's fine. If not, she's dangerous.\n Would she know where Estelle was the night of the alleged meeting?\nMaybe. Estelle often visits her old friend Lady Claire in the evening. Ask my wife if she knows what happened. She's a good woman and won't lie to protect a minister.\n Thank you for the information. You're a good Krytan.\n Congratulations. If you will excuse me, I'll continue my meandering.\n Who do you work for?\nI beg you pardon? I don't believe that's any of your business.\n I only ask because I see you there, ready to serve. *\nIf there's something you require, I recommend you speak with one of the party servers. I am preoccupied with other duties.\n All right. I'll do that.\n You're right. Excuse me.\n It's a sad day in Kryta.\nAfter picking the second option\nKasmeer Meade: That's another witness who can help us prove the queen's innocence. Nicely done.\nTalking to Kasmeer after gathering all evidence\nWhat do you think? Do we have enough evidence to discredit her accusations?\n Plenty. The servant's wife can testify that Estelle met with Lady Claire.\nMaybe the threat of her testifying will be enough to shut this down. What else?\n We have multiple witnesses who say the queen turned down Scarlet's request.\nI still can't believe Scarlet wanted to study with the watchknight engineer. Thank the gods the queen turned her down. Though, that might explain Scarlet's anger when she attacked our city. What else?\n We know Estelle's friend was lying for her.\nFor a pouch of gold, you mean. Estelle must have coached Lady Claire. I don't imagine it will be too hard to get her to testify for the lie. I guess they weren't such good friends after all.\n We're ready to confront Estelle with the evidence.\nAfter talking to Kasmeer\nKasmeer Meade: Looks like we've got everything we need. Time to expose Minister Estelle for the liar she is.\nApproaching Minister Estelle\nMinister Estelle: Gentlemen, please leave.\nMinister Estelle: I see you've been busy socializing with the guests.\nTalking to Kasmeer.\nDon't forget that we know she's seen and talked with Caudecus as recently as the garden party. If you catch her in a lie, call her on it!\n Got it.\nTalking to Minister Estelle\nHello, busy bee. I must admit, I'm a bit charmed by how you flit from flower to flower.\n(Before collecting all evidence)\n I've learned a few things about you.\nKasmeer: Wait. Are you sure it's the right time? I don't think we have all the information we need.\n Never mind. We'll be back.\n(After collecting all evidence)\n I know all about you.\nKasmeer: Listen closely to what Estelle says. Once she's finished, don't be afraid to ask her to repeat what she said. Press her only when you're certain she's lying.\n I have a question. Is it true that you work closely with Lord Caudecus?\nI used to work with Lord Caudecus, but now I'm considering retirement, I've started spending most of my time in the Ministry library. I hardly ever see him.\n That's not what I heard. * (after you've listened to her once)\nWhy would I lie about something like that? He's my boss's boss's boss. I don't work directly for him.\n I met someone who says you see Caudecus often. (proceeds to the next step)\n Let me think for a moment. I'll be back.\n Tell me more.\nAdmittedly, I occasionally do small tasks for him, but he's still recovering from that awful scandal. He keeps to himself most of the time.\n You attended his garden party not long ago. * (after you've listened to her once)\nOh, yes. I'd nearly forgotten about that. There was a large crowd there. I only saw the legate minister from across the roses.\n I heard there was only a handful of people there. (proceeds to the next step)\n Tell me more.\nEven at parties, Lord Caudecus is off doing his own thing and I'm left to my own devices. I'm just a wallflower, really.\n Shy, huh? (after you've listened to her once)\nOh yes. I barely spoke with anyone during that entire party. Beautiful garden, though.\n A witness said you had an aside with Caudecus. He talked. You nodded.\nFine. He and I talked, but you'll never learn the topic of that discussion, and you can't prove it had anything to do with the queen.\n I don't have to prove it. I just have to discredit you.\n Kasmeer, what do you think?\nKasmeer: Hm. She keeps back-paddling. Press her when she lies, and then present your evidence to counter her arguments.\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that?\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that? (after you've listened to her once)\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that? (after you've listened to her once)\n Let me think for a moment. I'll be back.\n Farewell.\nAfter taking the third branch (\"Shy, huh?\")\nMinister Estelle: Hm. So perhaps I misspoke. Apologies, I shall revise my statement.\nTalking to Kasmeer\nShe's a slug, if you pardon my crudeness. You can pin her down. Remenber Arton's version of events. He said Queen Jennah was short with Scarlet and that the countess even ushered her out quickly.\n Got it.\nMinister Estelle's revised statement\nSo what if I work with Lord Caudecus. It means nothing. It doesn't change the fact that I was there when Scarlet had her audience with the queen.\n Did you hear what the queen discussed with Scarlet?\nNo, they spoke too quietly, like schoolgirl friends whispering so no one else would hear.\n That's a lie. You heard everything. * (after hearing her statement once)\nI heard hushed words, but I couldn't make out any of them. The queen seemed pleased though.\n Minister Arton heard everything. His ears must be better than yours. (proceeds to the next step)\n Let me think for a moment. I'll be back.\n Tell me more.\nI must have been lost in my own thoughts while the queen and Scarlet conspired deviously.\n I heard the queen was escorted out for safety.\nYou weren't there. You can't possibly know how they behaved. Unless you questioned the goat?\n I spoke with Arton. His version agrees with the countess's...and the goat's.\nYes, well, one person's politeness is another's friendliness.\n That means nothing.\n Tell me more.\nI heard the word \"watchknights\".\n Tell me more.\nIsn't that bad enough? Do you know how many people died because the queen gave Scarlet access to the watchknights? Why are you still interrogating me? She's the criminal!\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that?\n Kasmeer, what do you think?\nShe's clever and slippery, but you can nail down those lies. Catch her off guard when she slips up.\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that?\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that? (after hearing her statement once)\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that? (after hearing her statement once)\n We'll do this later.\nAfter disproving this statement (second option, \"I heard the queen was escorted out for safety.\")\nMinister Estelle: Aren't you the nosy one. If you must know, I'll tell you what really happened.\nMinister Estelle's final statement\nIt doesn't matter what happened in the throne room. The queen arranged to meet with Scarlet later that evening. She didn't want any of us to hear them, so she sneaked out.\n You're sticking by the claim that they arranged this in the throne room?\nAbsolutely. Their foreheads were practically touching, they were so chummy. They agreed to something, and what else could it be?\n You're crazy. Anise would never let Scarlet get that close to the queen. * (after hearing her statement once)\nOh yes. She was on it too. All smiles and \"pet this\" and pet that.\"\n Minister Arton describes a very different atmosphere. (proceeds to the next step)\n Let me think for a moment. I'll be back.\n Tell me more.\nSo, it was brief. A look. A smile. Maybe they'd already arranged to meet later. I don't know. All I know is that I saw them under that bridge. It was the queen and Scarlet.\n Impossible! What TIME did you see them? * (after hearing her statement once)\nLater, about an hour after dark. They were in the Salma District. I caught sight of the queen's profile and nearly fainted. Why would she endanger herself like that?\n The queen was in her office with a charr emissary at that time. (proceeds to the next step)\n Let me think for a moment. I'll be back.\n Tell me more.\nI'm not the only one who saw her. There was another witness who came forward, a noblewoman.\n How many other witnesses do you have in your pocket? * (after hearing her statement once)\nEveryone knows we were in school together. That's no secret, but she and I haven't spoken in years.\n Someone paid her to lie, and I suspect it was you. (proceeds to the next step)\n Let me think for a moment. I'll be back.\n Tell me more.\nWhy are you working so hard to protect Queen Jennah? She sold us all out, and now she's just trying to cover her tracks. It was definitely Jennah, in a red cape.\n You told your accomplice to say it was a black cape.\nNo, it was a red cape. I think.\n Have you forgotten?\nYou're trying to confuse me. It was a red cape. I'm sure of it. Dark red.\n If you and your old friend can't agree on the color of the queen's cape...\nWait. I remember now. The queen was in a black cape, yes. Countess Anise was in a red one. Did I forget to mention they were both there? You know the countess wouldn't let the queen go anywhere alone.\n You're saying Countess Anise was there too? What?\nKasmeer: Clearly we need to discuss this further, <Character name>.\n Good idea.\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that?\n Kasmeer, what do you think? *\nMinister Estelle: You've been whispering this whole time. I won't have it. It's rude.\n Seriously? All right, if you would please repeat your statement then?\n Let me think for a moment. I'll be back.\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that? (after hearing her statement once)\n Minister Estelle, can you repeat that? (after hearing her statement once)\n Farewell.\nAfter Minister Estelle has accused Anise\nKasmeer Meade: This way.\nMinister Estelle: I think we're done here.\nTalking to Kasmeer\nWe need to eliminate any doubt about it. If there's even the smallest chance Estelle is telling the truth...\n She's not. But we need to hear Anise say she wasn't under that bridge.\nI'm sure I'd have sensed if this were some kind of mesmer cover-up, don't you think? It doesn't matter. I'll know if the countess is lying when we ask her.\n Let's go.\nTalking to Kasmeer again\nAnise is in the center of the party. Let's go talk to her.\n Interesting. Okay.\nApproaching Anise and Canach\nCanach: In absence of your orders, I've been occupying myself by planning the extermination of this entire gaggle of preening fools.\nCountess Anise: Stop. Don't approach her. It's an illusion. I am elsewhere. Find me, and we shall talk.\nCanach: I'd thought maybe some well-placed bombs here and there among the topiary, hm?\nCanach: Or perhaps I'll pick them off one by one with my blade. And hide the bodies in the pantry.\nCanach: I wonder, would that reflect poorly on your office? I imagine I'd become a hero to the Krytan people.\nCanach: And still no reaction. I wonder, Countess, are you even at all with me?\nCountess Anise: Mmm?\nFinding Anise\nCountess Anise: My apologies for the deception, but I must go to unconventional lengths to protect Kryta.\nKasmeer Meade: Countess, Minister Estelle is claiming that you were there, at the secret meeting. She's implicating you.\nCountess Anise: Nonsense. I was at no such meeting. I did, however, receive a mysterious message signed only with the initial E.\nCountess Anise: The note said that Estelle was in a bandit gambling parlor when she was supposedly spying on our queen.\nCountess Anise: Reminding her of this will be enough to make her drop her lie faster than Faren's dignity.\nTalking to Kasmeer\nThat's it. The final piece of the puzzle. Now we have everything we need. We have the testimonies of Minister Arton, the servant's wife, the lying noble, the guards, and the countess herself.\n But we don't have proof that Estelle was gambling that night.\nShe won't know that. If we present it to her with all the other evidence, as if we know her little secret, then maybe she'll confess.\n All right. Let's go get a confession.\nWalking by Canach\nCanach: It may have taken me a while, Countess, but I've finally realized my part in your misdirection.\nCanach: If you can hear me through your illusion, don't worry. I will continue to draw the attention of your guests.\nCountess Anise: Hmm?\nComing back to Estelle\nMinister Estelle: You again? I hope you're not planning another interrogation. This is a party if you haven't noticed.\nTalking to Estelle\nI imagine Countess Anise had a lie to cover up her presence at the bridge. It's her word against mine.\n Actually, Minister, it's several people's words against yours.\nWhat are you talking about? Has someone said they'd testify against me?\n We have witnesses who will support Countess Anise's story.\nTraitors to the Ministry. Traitors! They'll find themselves in the streets soon.\n I doubt it. The queen has positions for those who are honest and honorable.\nKasmeer: There are those of us who see through the Ministry's lies. And our numbers are growing.\n Jory would approve, eh, Kas? Good-bye, Minister.\nFinal conversation\nMinister Estelle: I'll have you know I'm very well-connected, and I—\nKasmeer Meade: Your connections can't help you with this. We know what you've been up to.\nMinister Estelle: What? What do you mean?\nKasmeer Meade: We know you couldn't have witnessed this supposed meeting with Scarlet. We hear you were busy meeting some \"lobbyists\" that day.\nMinister Estelle: Lobbyists? What are you talking about.\nKasmeer Meade: So much for subtlety. You were busy gambling with some ruffians.\nMinister Estelle: Keep your voice down! That's a baseless accusation!\nCountess Anise: Is that so, Minister Estelle? Perhaps you and I should speak privately and sort this little mess out. Please follow my guards. I'll be with you shortly.\nKasmeer Meade: Countess Anise, thank you for inviting us to your party. It's been an entertaining—and productive—evening.\nCountess Anise: No one is more delighted by your presence than I. With all that socializing and skulduggery, you must be craving the longest of naps.\nCountess Anise: Now that this messy affair is out of the way, I feel fairly certain that the Queen will attend your summit.\nCountess Anise: I think Minister Estelle will soon see the value in cooperating with me rather than rotting in prison for treason. I may have use for her. On a separate note, I do hope you will stay and join the queen's entourage, Kasmeer.\nKasmeer Meade: You mean travel with the queen to the summit? I'd be honored!\nCountess Anise: Yes, I think that's the right play. You will, of course, have time to relay the full details of your father's story at that time.\nKasmeer Meade: Oh, I don't think the queen would be interested in—\nCountess Anise: Nonsense. Now go. Say pretty things to my guests, and enjoy yourselves for the rest of the evening.\nTalking to Kasmeer\nI can't wait to tell Jory how you solved this mystery. She's going to be so proud of you.\n And of you. That lie-detecting thing you do...wow.\nIt certainly comes in handy. Though it's still a bit unreliable. It works best on total strangers. I keep practicing though.\n Will you be going with Marjory to the summit?\nThe countess asked if I'd travel with the queen to the summit. It's an honor to be asked. I'll see you there, though. Who knows? This may be my chance to get my title back.\n That would be wonderful. Be safe, and I'll see you in the Grove.\nTalking to Anise\nYou must visit more often. The party wouldn't have been nearly as much fun without you. The queen sends her gratitude as well. She can now attend your summit. I'll be here as well, though...incognito.\n That's wonderful news. I appreciate your support, Countess.\nIf you have no objection, I believe I will keep dear Kasmeer with me for a while. We have much to talk about, don't we, pet?\n One last question. If you knew Estelle was guilty, why not just out her?\nPut simply, I'm too close to the queen for my claims to be believable without support. I'd lose much if our dear Jennah was incarcerated, and the ministers know it. That's where you come in.\n I understand. Well, I won't keep you any longer. Good-bye for now.\nAfter the quest has ended\nCanach: Ah, there you are, Countess. I trust I played my part in your charade this evening?\nCountess Anise: (laugh) There, there, blossom. You did very well as the sore green thumb at my affair.\nCountess Anise: I'm sure everyone was far too intimidated by your glowering menace to notice it was an illusion standing beside you the whole time.\nCanach: Yes. I thought you seemed rather vapid.\n* These choices raise the suspicion level.\n^ These choices lower the suspicion level.\n\nWhen suspicion reaches maximum\nNoble: Oh, the audacity! Where are your manners?\nNoble: Guards. Please escort these...scandalmongers to the gates.\nKasmeer Meade: Oh no. This...isn't what was supposed to happen.\nTalking to Kasmeer\nOoh, that's disorienting. My goodness.\n What just happened?\nIt felt like a mesmer spell. I think Anise created a diversion for us. Let's get back into the party.\n Let's go.\n\n\n=== Ambient dialogue ===\nCaterer: May I fill your glass for you?\nCaterer: I can take that. Thank you.\nCaterer: Care for an hors d'oeuvre?\nCaterer: Here, I can get you some more.\nCaterer: Hors d'oeuvre?\nCaterer: May I take your glass, if you're finished?\nCaterer: How is everything?\n(Chauncey von Snuffles III runs towards the catering table.)\nCaterer: (giggle) Is that cat wearing spectacles?\nCaterer: Isn't that the cat from the Eastern Commons? The fancy one, Jaunty Snuffles or something?\nCaterer: Aw, who put that hat on him? Adorable.\nHead Caterer: Oh gods. How did that cat get in here? It's helped itself to the truffle steak.\nHead Caterer: Someone get rid of that filthy cat before the guests see it, or—or the countess herself.\nCaterer: I'll deal with it.\n(Caterer threatens Chauncey and he runs away.)\nHead Caterer: Why aren't they eating the tarts? Oh, I knew those omnomberries were out of season.\nHead Caterer: (moan) No one's touched the souffle.\nHead Caterer: I want whoever put those pies out this early thrown off the city walls immediately!\nHead Caterer: How long have we been out of the stuffed artichokes?\nHead Caterer: How are we doing on the lotus fries? Please tell me we still have more.\nHead Caterer: Who is that brute who's been looming over the countess all evening? I need to ask her preference on dessert wine, but...\nHead Caterer: How is everything? Oh, I do hope you're enjoying our offerings.\nHead Caterer: I'm very sorry to hear our clams weren't up to your high standards. We imported them direct this morning.\nHead Caterer: Tell me, have you tried our piccata? It's as if Melandru herself kissed it with just a hint of dill. (smack)\nHead Caterer: I assure you that the chef responsible for this will be dealt with at once.\n\n\n== My story ==",

      "strWikiText": "The World Summit is the fourth and final story episode in the The Dragon's Reach: Part 2 chapter of Living World Season 2.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nAttend the world summit and present your case.\nTravel to the Grove.\nMeet with your companions.\nCheck in with Trahearne.\nWitness the procession of world leaders.\nHead to the Omphalos Chamber.\nPresent evidence of the Mordrem threat.\nAddress Imperator Smodur's concerns.\nAddress Knut Whitebear's concerns.\nAddress Councillor Phlunt's concerns.\nAddress Queen Jennah's concerns.\nSave the world leaders from Mordrem.\nCheck on the Pale Tree.\nInvestigate the sound.\nDefeat the Shadow of the Dragon.\nShadow of the Dragon\nReturn to the Pale Tree.\nCheck on the world leaders.\nCheck in with Trahearne.\nTell your companions about the vision.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n  Enormous Foxfire Cluster\n  Mordrem Seed Pouch (5)\n  Medium Bag of Geodes\n  Thorny Seed Pouch\n  Dragonite Ore (10)\n\n\n== Event ==\n Destroy the Shadow of the Dragon (80)\nShadow of the Dragon\n\n Destroy the dragon tendrils to weaken the Shadow of the Dragon (80)\nDragon Tendrils remaining: X\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nAssist to cutscenes leading up to the summit, then go through the dialogue that follows as you convince the leaders one by one.\nAfter that, Mordrem will start attacking the Omphalos Chamber, trapping you there. You need to kill the Mordrem around each world leader so that they can escape through Kasmeer's portal. After the last leader is gone, talk to the Avatar of the Tree and the Shadow of the Dragon will spawn.\nThis boss is fought in two phases that alternate with one another. First, you need to destroy dragon tendrils while the Shadow of the Dragon attacks from the exterior of the Chamber. Its attacks include:\n\nA claw attack, which cause massive damage where the claws land and two conical AoEs where roots damage and cripple you for some time afterwards\nA breath attack, poisonous projectiles, similar to the Tendrils', which hit circular AoEs.\nA stomp attack, which hits the entire Chamber. The orange indicator becomes brighter as the attack nears; dodge roll or jump at the right time to avoid it. Otherwise, you'll be knocked down and will take massive damage.  This can result in an insta-kill for professions on the lower end of health ranges.\nOnce the tendrils are all gone, the Shadow of the Dragon will be vulnerable for you to hit. You have a very short time until the first phase starts over; furthermore, you can only take away 25% of its health in a single phase. As it gets weaker, it will also start summoning Mordrem when it is vulnerable to distract you; the Thrashers in particular can pose a very serious threat.\nIt is critical to note if the boss is not defeated after a certain number of rounds of root killing and damaging the boss, its health will be completely reset to full.  This can result in being stuck in an infinite loop in the fight. If you see this happening you should quit the mission and run it again with a different build having much higher DPS and more range or bring a group to help. It will mean you will have to sit through the entire procession cutscene again.  \nAfterwards, just talk to the various characters to end the quest.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nComplete the story step.\n\nChallenge mote is not visible on the first play through of the story on a given character, and is only visible on subsequent visits on that character, despite the  Mote Master effect visible even on the first play.\nTo get this achievement, the party member who started the instance needs to interact with the Challenge Mote, then you need to triumph over the boss with that mode active and without dying more than twice (each death removes one stack of the eligibility buff, and you start with 3 stacks). The Challenge Mote is a blue orb forward and to your left as you enter the instance, between a flower and a Warden Scout.\nThe only difference in this mode is that healing pods will appear, which continuously heal the Shadow of the Dragon. These pods are invulnerable, but they also target party members with an attack that traps them in another pod, and covers them in spores. Break free (or have allies break you free) and you'll be able to break the healing pods. Aside from that, the fight is mostly unchanged.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Mote Master effect.\n\nTo get this achievement, you need to avoid all stomp attacks—the ones that hit the entire Chamber. You can do this by jumping or dodge-rolling, regardless of what the achievement description says.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Can't Knock Me Down effect.\n\nTo get this achievement, you need to avoid all claw attacks and breath attacks. These are all indicated by orange AoEs before they happen; an easy way to avoid most of them is to stand in the northeastern alcove of the Omphalos Chamber.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Untouched by Maw and Claw effect.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nArcane Eye Agent\nPeacemaker Officer\nPhlunt\nTaimi\nCharr\nImperator Smodur the Unflinching\nIron Legion Soldier\nRox\nIron Legion Captain\nHumans\nCountess Anise\nKasmeer Meade\nMarjory Delaqua\nQueen Jennah\nSeraph Honor Guard\nSeraph Soldier\nShining Blade\nNorn\nBraham Eirsson\nKnut Whitebear\nWarrior\nHunter\nSylvari\nAvatar of the Tree\nCanach\nCaithe\nCitizen\nFarmer\nHerald\nLaranthir of the Wild\nMender Aine\nOnlooker\nTrahearne\nWarden Lochin\nWarden Scout\nWarden Ranger\nQuaggans\nBloomanoo\nPeneloopee\nPlant\nSylvan Hound\nDevourer\nFrostbite\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nMordrem\nDragon Tendril\nMordrem Husk\nMordrem Leeching Thrasher\nMordrem Wolf\nShadow of the Dragon\n\n\n== Objects ==\nSummit Lectern\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nWhen entering the instance\nCountess Anise: You seem uncomfortable being back home in the Grove, blossom.\nCanach: I despise both puns and pet names, Countess. But as long as you hold my billet, I will go where you need me.\nCountess Anise: Worried your mother might not approve of all your naughty misadventures?\nCanach: I'm sure she has far larger concerns.\nCountess Anise: True, you are only one among her thousands of children. Not as dear as her firstborn, like our heroic Pact Marshal.\nCanach: It may be wiser to focus such commentary on someone without a violent criminal history, Countess.\nQuaggans in the background\nBloomanoo: Quaggan thinks is a good time to be in the Grove. Something big is happening.\nPeneloopee: Maybe quaggans will see someone famous at this summit.\nTalking to Countess Anise\nGreetings, stranger. I'm all abloom with delight at meeting so many different people.\n Countess, I know it's you.\nYou've always been the clever one. Well, I beseech you not to give away my little secret. It's for the queen's security.\n I'll leave you to your pretense, but first, has Canach been behaving?\nAbsolutely. He's the perfect companion. If his tongue ever stops wagging, I'll die of surprise.\n If you have any trouble with him, you let me know.\nCanach: I'm sure the countess appreciates your offer, but you can rest assured that I do not intend to cross any line she hasn't asked me to cross.\n You'd better not.\nCountess Anise: Don't worry, my friend. I have far more painful threats to hang over his head than the edge of your weapon. But I do appreciate your thoughtfulness.\n A pleasure as always, Countess.\n Have no fear. Your secret is safe with me.\n That's one of the best things about these gatherings.\nTalking to Canach\nQuite a change from having rotten vegetables thrown at me in my jail cell.\n We can always put you back.\nApproaching your companions\nBraham Eirsson: We did it. They're all coming.\nTaimi: So they said. I'll believe it when I see it.\nBraham Eirsson: Everyone understands how important this is. They'll be here.\nMarjory Delaqua: Remember your place here. We have an audience with them. It's not a party.\nRox: Agreed. We may not be able to speak at all. They're here to talk to one another.\nTaimi: They'll listen to the boss. I know it.\nAfter listening to your companions\nCountess Anise: This envy of your older siblings ill becomes you. You'd do well to find a way past it.\nCountess Anise: I think you overestimate the value of being first. A windfallen fruit has never appealed to me as much as one left on the bough to ripen.\nCanach: You do keep those blades of yours keen, Countess.\nCountess Anise: Forgive my meddling, petal. It's just that I see such potential in you.\nCanach: Petal? I fear you've only employed me in order to sharpen your wit-or work on your plant puns. Why not prove me wrong and tell me your true purpose?\nCountess Anise: All in good time.\nCanach: Do you treat everyone you encounter like children?\nCountess Anise: (laugh) You are a delicate flower, aren't you? So easily bruised...\nCanach: I have a thick skin. I also learn from my missteps. For example, you fooled me once with your illusions, so now I wonder if you're truly as young as-\nCountess Anise: Do not finish that sentence. Not here, not ever.\nCanach: At last, a substantial response.\nCountess Anise: Yes, well. You would be wise to remember your place and check that tongue of yours.\nCanach: When will you tell me why you brought me here?\nCountess Anise: I'm trying to decide if I can trust you out in the field. I mean, after that nasty business on Southsun Cove. Tsk.\nCanach: Regardless of what you may believe, I was trying to free those refugees from the Consortium's exploitation.\nCanach: I went about it...poorly. Criminally. And I answered for my crimes.\nCountess Anise: Your intentions in that affair, whether noble or not, aren't what concern me. It's your failure to evade capture.\nCanach: I beg your pardon?\nCountess Anise: Noble intentions don't interest me. What I need is a sharp instrument. A knife that can be employed before anyone realizes it's struck.\nCanach: Show me where to cut, Countess, and I will be your blade.\nTalking to Laranthir\nI look forward to the outcome of your summit. Unlike others, I am less pessimistic.\n(If not Vigil)\n Your vote of confidence is appreciated, Laranthir.\nI am a warrior, but this enemy has me shaking. We must give this fight everything we have, or we will fail.\n I agree.\n(If Vigil)\n For the Vigil, Grand Warmaster.\nFor Tyria. I do believe this situation calls for us to think in larger terms about loyalties.\n I agree.\nTalking to Trahearne\nI had a word of this summit from the Mother Tree. You're doing a good thing. Those of us who remember the encounter with Zhaitan know how merciless the Elder Dragons can be. I applaud your effort.\n Your presence is appreciated.\nI'm only here to give you moral support and to answer any questions about the Pact's current plans. You're the one who must make the world leaders see that this is a matter of dire importance.\n What's happening with the Pact?\nWe've regrouped and regained some of our strength after Zhaitan. We had been planning to go after Kralkatorrik, but then we all heard the dragon's bellow.\n Are you ready to take on Mordremoth?\nNot yet. But we will be soon. We're setting up a forward camp from which to begin the assault. I will call on you at some point in the future. We'll need your special skills.\n I've been away.\nI had noticed. While I would prefer you at my side, I also know that you have been instrumental in saving many lives. You have your own path, my friend. Who am I to say it's less important than mine?\n It's been one thing after another, I must admit.\nI suspect you have many stories to tell, and we'll talk more soon. But for now, I believe you have a world to unite. I'm confident the attendees will listen to you. Good luck.\n Thank you.\nTalking to Marjory\nI find myself watching the crowd and thinking how easy it would be for an assassin to slip in here.\n Just stay alert.\nDuring the procession of world leaders\nOnlooker: Shhh!\nOnlooker: Shh!\nOnlooker: Quiet!\nHerald: Announcing Her Royal Majesty, Queen Jennah of Divinity's Reach.\nKasmeer Meade: Hi, you made it! (Speaking to Marjory)\nMarjory Delaqua: You look beautiful. Now go! Before the queen notices you're gone.\nKasmeer Meade: I missed you.\nMarjory Delaqua: Me too!\nHerald: Representing the Great Lodge of Hoelbrak, Knut Whitebear.\nOnlooker: Ooooh!\nOnlooker: Ahhh!\nOnlooker: Ohhhh!\nOnlooker: Wow!\nBraham Eirsson: And there he is. Thanks, Knut.\nHerald: On behalf of Rata Sum's Arcane Council, Councillor Phlunt.\nTaimi: Phlunt. I hope he trips on his robes.\nHerald: And finally, Smodur the Unflinching, imperator of the Black Citadel.\nRox: For the Legions!\nQuaggans commenting on the procession (only ambient and not in chat)\nBloomanoo: A queen, actually. She is Queen Jennah of Kryta.\nPeneloopee: That norn must be sweating in all those furs.\nBloomanoo: Quaggan dosn't think norn sweat. Especially not legendary heroes like Knut Whitebear. He is a norn leader.\nPeneloopee: Quaggan didn't think norn had leaders.\nBloomanoo: Only in homesteads and Hoelbrak, where they need someone to make rules to avoid chaos.\nBloomanoo: Look, Peneloopee. That's an important leader of the charr. Coo.\nPeneloopee: Oh. Quaggan wouldn't want to make him angry.\nBloomanoo: Noo-ho-ho-hooo. (laugh)\nTalking to Caithe\nYou look good, <Character name>. Healthy. Mostly. What are you going to say to everyone?\n I'm going to tell them how dangerous Mordremoth is.\nGood. You should do that. Mordremoth will destroy half the world if it isn't stopped. I'm looking for a way to stop it too.\n I'm glad. I wish us both luck.\nTalking to your companions\nRox: Why am I suddenly so nervous?\n Everything will be fine.\nTaimi: This is surprisingly exciting!\n I agree.\nBraham: Something tells me Eir would have enjoyed this. It's too bad she's stuck in Hoelbrak.\n Yes, I think she would have.\nAfter the procession of world leaders\nWarden Ranger: Pardon me. The world leaders are assembled and awaiting your presence. You may proceed to the Omphalos Chamber.\nRox: That's our cue. Best behavior, everyone.\nTaimi: I can't wait to see Phlunt's stupid face when he realizes we're right.\nWarden Ranger: Pardon. I'm sorry to interject myself, but I'm afraid your golem won't be allowed to ascend to the Omphalos Chamber.\nTaimi: What? No.\nRox: This is for grown-ups anyway, Taimi. You need to wait for us down here.\nTaimi: You're kidding right?\nBraham Eirsson: Somebody needs to stay down here and guard our backs. We'll be vulnerable up there.\nBraham Eirsson: I'll tell you all about it later. Promise.\nTaimi: You'd better remember every little detail, Braham. All right. Scruffy and I will guard the way up.\nMore Quaggan comments (only ambient and not in chat)\nPeneloopee: Ooh, that's Caithe. She's a member of Destiny's Edge. They say she's a skilled thief.\nBloomanoo: Quaggan has heard of her brave deeds. She fought Kralkatorrik. She failed, but she stood up to it and growled.\nTalking to Taimi\nI've got your backs. I'll be here when you're done. And you have to tell me everything.\n I will. I promise.\nUpon entering the Omphalos Chamber\nAvatar of the Tree: Esteemed leaders, welcome to the Grove. Your attendance at this critical summit is appreciated.\nAvatar of the Tree: We are here at the behest of the honored group you see before you.\nAvatar of the Tree: I'm told you're all familiar with one another, so I won't make introductions. I will, however, let their spokesperson give us a summary.\nAvatar of the Tree: So, without further ado... Please begin.\nTalking to your companions\nMarjory: If you get cornered, just look at one of us and we'll help you out. Kasmeer especially. She's got a gift for saying the right thing in social situations.\n I'll be fine.\nKasmeer: Whenever I'm nervous, I take long deep breaths. Try it. It will help.\n I'm not nervous. Not much.\nRox: They're all ears. Go get 'em!\n I'm ready.\nBraham: You got this. Use that silver tongue of yours.\n Okay.\nPresenting evidence to the summit\nGreetings. I'm <Character name>. Thank you for coming. It says much about your leadership that you did. We've all been hearing about Mordremoth's awakening and the damage the Elder Dragon has already wrought.\nContinue.\nIn the time that this dragon has been awake, it has been sending out vines as far as the Iron Marches. Soon Tyria will be nothing more than a giant briar patch. These vines are malicious.\n Take a breath. Continue.\nFort Salma has been destroyed. Fort Concordia as well. Their defenses could not keep out an enemy that rises from beneath, shaking the very foundation of their walls and towers.\n Continue.\nWe can't know where it will attack until it does. No one is safe. Our familiar, our people, our trade routes... Most recently, our waypoints were threatened. They may be again someday.\n Continue.\nThis is why I stand before you and ask that you, the most powerful leaders of Tyria, link arms and armies and work together to keep one and all safe and secure.\n Continue.\nIt's up to us. There is no one else. We must unite. We are all Tyrians.\n Thank you for listening.\nAfter the presentation\nAvatar of the Tree: Thank you for that information. Esteemed leaders, what are your thoughts?\nImperator Smodur the Unflinching: Mordremoth. (sigh) Its attacks have been far-reaching, but unfocused. Meanwhile, Ascalonian ghosts continue to harass us.\nAddressing Smodur's concerns\nIf the Ascalonian ghosts aren't reason enough, we have an army of Flame Legion constantly nipping at our heels, just waiting for us to leave the Black Citadel unprotected so they can invade.\n And when Mordremoth has destroyed your citadel? What then?\n(Charr) And when Mordremoth has destroyed our citadel? What then?\nThat will happen over my dead body! How can you even suggest such a thing?\n It already destroyed two forts. A friend lost her sister in one of those.\nYou should visit us in our territory one day, so you can see how the Flame Legion and Ascalonian ghosts kill our loved ones. Then perhaps you will understand why we can spare no one.\n(Charr) And you and I lose soldiers every day to the ghosts and Flame Legion. We must defend our land.\n Don't you have hope now that you can deal with the ghosts?\n(Charr) You have hope now that the ghosts can be sent to the Mists.\nYes, I suppose I do. And that does allow me to relax one eye. But only one. You were instrumental in that experiment, and though it wasn't completely successful, I do believe we will be one day.\n(Charr) True, You were instrumental in that. I saw it with my own two eyes.\n I truly believe Mordremoth is the greatest threat right now.\n (Charr) Sir, I truly believe Mordremoth is the greatest threat right now.\nThey're plant creatures! How hard can they be to fight.[sic] One good flamethrower and...\n With all due respect, those two forts were defended by Vigil and Seraph.\nThey were unprepared, taken by surprise. In the future, everyone will be more alert and ready.\n I saw with my own two eyes how those places were torn asunder.\nI heard it was bad. (sigh) Okay. I respect you, and that alone is the reason I'm agreeing to explore this. I make no commitment, but I'll participate in the discussions.\n Thank you Imperator.\nKnut Whitebear: Hoelbrak has its hands full with Jormag and the Sons of Svanir. You want us to leave our homesteads to their mercy and go after Mordremoth?\nAddressing Knut's concerns\nI remember the day Jormag awoke and begun spewing cold hatred upon my people. I've lost friends. Family. And every single day it's a struggle to keep from losing more.\n Mordremoth doesn't care if you're too busy to fight back. It's coming.\n(Norn) In the past, we've been prey. It's time to become the hunters we are.\nMordremoth is not yet as close as the Sons of Svanir. They press in around our homesteads. That is more important.\n(Norn) I see your point. Predators go after the herd's weakest, and we won't be the weakest. We're not an army, and I'm not your leader. But I see the value in taking down the biggest predator first.\n If you wait until Mordremoth attacks to react, it will be too late.\n(Norn) I know many who'd howl at a chance to make their legend with this fight.\nI do not command an army. My people make up their own minds and follow their own legends.\n(Norn) As do I. I command no one, but I will relay what you have said and I will have a representative at the table when the discussions happen. By Wolf, I may even join the battle myself.\n Then make them aware. Join the discussion and relay what you hear.\n (Norn) I look forward to the day.\n(Norn) Conversation ends.\nThat is something I can do. The hunters choose their own prey, but I can make sure they know what's coming. I know many who would leap at the chance to fight a dragon!\n That's all I ask.\nKnut Whitebear: I have Wolfborn and hunters who are eager to face the prey of a lifetime. They'll come.\nCouncillor Phlunt: Why isn't the Pact handling this? Are they mired in Orr?\nAddressing Councillor Phlunt's concerns\n\nAren't you being a bit alarmist? What does Trahearne have to say? I want to know what he and the Pact are doing about all this. It's their job, after all.\n You've seen for yourself what the Mordrem can do, Councilor.\nTrahearne: And if I may interrupt, this Pact commander has far more knowledge about Mordremoth than I do. I am hear to learn, to listen, and to consider—as you all should do. The Pact is not all powerful.\n I'm sure the Pact will do all they can, but they won't be enough.\nCouncillor Phlunt: Won't be enough? Why not? You took down Zhaitan. What's so different about this one. Just do it again.\n We lost many in that fight. The orders' numbers are reduced.\nWell, that's your responsibility. Many of those lost were asura.\n All the more reason not to cut yourselves off from the rest of us.\nWe have ample protection. Are you saying we should put ourselves on the line to protect all of you? We are safe in Rata Sum.\n Are you? Like you were safe underground?\nHmph. Point well made. Though it galls me to say it, if we hadn't come to the surface, Primordus and its destroyers would have annihilated my people.\n Then you see the wisdom in joining forces with others who also want safety.\nFor now. We will continue to study the situation and participate in discussion with the other races. For now.\n Thank you, Councillor.\nCouncillor Phlunt: Much as I loathe to admit it, Rata Sum has evidence of Mordremoth's insidious invasion. Its tendrils prey upon the magic that powers our waypoints and gates.\nQueen Jennah: I don't doubt that Mordremoth is a great threat to Tyria, but the safety of my people must be my foremost priority.\nAddressing Queen Jennah's concerns\nWe are brave and strong, but we are few. For so long we have been at war. Centaurs run right up to our doorstep. Every week, I send letters of condolence to families who have lost loved ones.\n(If human)\n Your Majesty, our situation is no different from any of these others.\n(Otherwise)\n Your situation is no different than any of these others.\nPerhaps that's true. We all have a responsibility to protect our people and see them prosper. But I'm not ashamed to admit that I don't see how this will work. What are you asking of us?\n All I'm asking is that you talk to one another.\nTalk? How will that help? I can barely get a cease-fire with the Charr, and you want us to coordinate efforts against the dragons?\n This is a chance to solidify relations with the Charr over a common enemy.\nYou make a good point. However, I cannot promise today that we will march into battle with you.\n If you'll join the discussion, you'll find the best way to contribute.\nI do have strategists and researchers that aren't needed to fight centaurs. I can form them into a team and ask the best way to proceed against Mordremoth.\n The entire world is in grave danger. We all have a role to play.\nYes, I believe I see. You have opened my eyes to the breadth and depth of this threat. It's not another kingdom that is in danger. It's all our kingdoms. All our peoples.\n Magic is the lifeblood of Tyria. Without it, I hate to think...\nI will explore how my people can support the effort. You have my word.\n And I don't have all the answers. But we'll find them if we work together.\nQueen Jennah: I will dedicate a special force to dealing with this new threat. If there is no Tyria, there is no Divinity's Reach.\nAvatar of the Tree: You have all given me hope for Tyria. It seems we-\nImperator Smodur: Weapons out! We're under attack!\nTrahearne: The enemy is here. Defend yourselves!\nTaimi: Hey, guys? We've got uninvited company down here!\nRox: Up here, too!\nBraham Eirrson: Taimi, get in your golem and hold the line. We'll send the leaders down once it's safe.\nTaimi: You can't! They tore up the lift as soon as they got here! You're trapped up there.\nMarjory Delaqua: No, we're not. Kas, start preparing a-\nKasmeer Meade: Portal. Already on it.\nBraham Eirrson: Okay, let's start clearing out the Mordrem and get the leaders to Kasmeer's portal. C'mon!\nFighting near Knut\nKnut Whitebear: It's been ages since I've fought a battle such as this! Bring on Mordremoth!\nBraham Eirrson: Way's clear! I'm heading down with Whitebear. (once the group is saved)\nFighting near Smodur\nImperator Smodur: Tear those Mordrem apart!\nRox: The way is clear, sir. (once the group is saved)\nFighting near Jennah\nQueen Jennah: My shield will protect me. Assist the guards. Go!\nMarjory Delaqua: This way, your Majesty. I'll accompany you down. (once the group is saved)\nFighting near Phlunt\nCouncillor Phlunt: I'm too important to die!\nCouncillor Phlunt: Arcane Eye, to me! We leave now. (once the group is saved)\nOnce all four leaders are out\nKasmeer Meade: That's all of them. Go on through. I'll keep the portal open as long as I can.\nAvatar of the Tree: Wait...Before you go. I must speak with you alone.\nSpeaking with Avatar of the Tree\nCome closer...yes. Yes, I can sense you clearly now. I am...weakened.\n Are you okay? What happened to you?\nI...I can't take much more. The assault was...fierce. These Mordrem tore at my roots and battered my branches. And...be warned. There is another...\n Another Mordrem?\nYes. One of the most dangerous...it comes directly from Mordremoth. (If sylvari: You know it from your Dream.) It draws nearer! If I die...\n (If sylvari) You will not die today, Mother! Where is it? Tell me!\n (Otherwise) You will not die today. Where is it? Tell me!\nShh... Listen. You will hear it approach.\n I will stand in its way.\nWhen the Shadow of the Dragon appears\nBraham Eirsson: Kasmeer! What happened? Where'd your portal go?\nKasmeer Meade: I...I don't know! It was holding strong, then all of a sudden it was cut off!\nTaimi: (scream) It's attacking the chamber!\nRox: Hang on! We'll do what we can from down here! Just hang on!\nDuring the fight (depending on the Shadow of the Dragon's actions)\nKasmeer Meade: Ah! Look out! It's getting ready to stomp the tree.\nBraham Eirsson: Watch out. It's heading to the rear of the chamber!\nMarjory Delaqua: On your right. Dragon's scooting around the limbs.\nRox: Look for weak points when it attacks.\nAfter defeating Shadow of the Dragon\nAvatar of the Tree: The threat has been...quelled for now. (groan) Please, come closer.\nChecking on the Pale Tree (cutscene)\nAvatar of the Tree: I must share something with you.\nAvatar of the Tree: I'm fading...\nAfter the vision.\nKasmeer Meade: It's working. I've reestablished the portal flow. Come on down!\nWarden Scout: Mother! Are you all right?\nWarden Scout: Quickly! She's hurt and needs mending!\nTalking to the avatar\nThe avatar of the Pale Tree is barely breathing. She does not respond.\n Leave.\nTalking to the Warden Scout\nThere's nothing more you can do here. We'll take care of her as best we can. Thank you helping porotect her.\n I hope she'll be okay. Good-bye.\nTalking to the assembled leaders\nImperator Smodur: We'll head back as soon as we've helped these Sylvari.\n That's thoughtful of you, Imperator. Then what?\nThen I have a strategy session with my tribunes. They need to know what I learned here today. After that, I'll delegate someone to work with the other races.\n That's a smart plan.\nI know.\n Yes, Imperator.\nKnut Whitebear: Wolf would be proud of the beating we gave that dragon! I can't wait to tell my sons about this. They'll start polishing their weapons to fight Mordremoth before I even finish telling the tale.\n You fought well.\nCouncillor Phlunt: As much as I appreciate your efforts in fending off that monstrosity's attack, I'm anxious to depart this overly fragrant hothouse and relay these developments to my colleagues in Rata Sum.\n You may leave whenever you like, Councillor. Now is good.\nQueen Jennah: It would appear that you were right. This attack kills any doubts I had about how dangerous Mordremoth is. Please, if you learn anything else about this, would you let me know?\n I'll pass along what information I can, Your Majesty.\nTalking to Trahearne\nI am leaving now. I am eager to return to Fort Trinity and continue our preparations against Mordremoth.\n This reminded me of Blightghast at Claw Island.\nPoor Lion's Arch. It has had more than its fair share of bad luck lately.\n Far more.\nThere is an intelligence to this attack that does not fit what I know about Elder Dragons.\n Agreed. The attack was too well timed.\nWe need more information. Who knew about the Summit?\n Only those present and anyone they told.\nToo many. Information like that leaks like water through cotton. Not helpful. Someone sent the Shadow of the Dragon after us. (If sylvari) You remember that creature from your Dream, don't you?\n(Otherwise)\n Who would do such a thing?\nI don't know. But, I intend to find out. Someone with a heart full of darkness.\n I hope they rot.\n(If sylvari)\n How could I forget?\nThe things we see in our Dreams have a way of coming around. Your wyld hunt... Do you feel the call yet?\n I haven't for some time, but I feel it now. Is this a new one?\nIt is the same one. You helped to destroy Zhaitan, but that did not complete your wyld hunt. The next phase is beginning.\n The Elder Dragons... Mordremoth.\nTalking to Laranthir\nI feel like a newly awakened sprout, so vulnerable. The Pale Tree—my home, my mother, my retreat... I never thought to see the day when she would be weakened.\n This is what the battle against Mordremoth will be like.\nApproaching your companions\nKasmeer Meade: Oh my gods! That was horrible! I'm still shaking.\nTaimi: Is the Pale Tree going to be okay?\nRox: No one seems to know. The Sylvari I talked to have never seen her like this. That dragon hurt her badly.\nMarjory Delaqua: That Zephyrite saboteur had a note on him that pointed to an important target—a leader. Do you think he meant the Pale Tree?\nBraham Eirsson: I think he took that answer to the grave. But that dragon minion sure convinced people that this summit wasn't a waste of time after all.\nRox: Are you feeling okay, boss? You've got a strange look on your face.\nTalking to Rox\nRox What happened up there?\n The Pale Tree, before she lost consciousness, gave me a vision.\nBraham Eirsson A vision? What kind of vision?\n I don't know. There was a golden light and crystals everywhere.\nTaimi: You sure that dragon didn't just give you a bump on the head?\n Positive. The Pale Tree showed me... It felt like a call to action.\nKasmeer: What action? What was she talking about?\n I'm afraid I don't know.\nRox: It's okay. We'll figure it out.\n Yeah, and the first thing is to learn all we can about dragons.\nBraham: Just tell us how we can help.\n Kas and Jory, I want you two to go to the Durmand Priory.\nMarjory: Research is right up my alley. We'll go straight there. One of us will mail you when we have enough information to share.\n Thanks! Taimi, you need to continue your own research. But keep it quiet.\nTaimi: Yeah, we don't want any more nosy councilors butting in and derailing my work. I'll be discreet, boss. Everyone will think I'm just doing schoolwork.\n Perfect. Braham and Rox, stay close to Taimi, in case she needs anything.\nRox You got it, boss. But what about you? What are you going to do?\n Decipher that vision. Tyria's future depends on it.\nCountess Anise: Very well, Canach. Playtime is over and you've passed your audition. You're to go with them.\nCanach: Why?\nCountess Anise: I want you to learn what you can about the Pact's plans. Follow them to their staging area.\nCountess Anise: I need someone there I know can get the job done, and I believe you may be that someone.\nCanach: I shall prove you correct. Until we meet again.\nTalking to your companions\nKasmeer: What a horror that beast was. I can't imagine what it was like for you up there on the upper level. You weren't injured at all, were you?\n No. I'm fine.\nBraham: It got away. We have to go after it. What was that thing?\n(If sylvari)\n It was the Shadow of the Dragon. I saw it in my Dream.\nWhat do you mean you saw it in your Dream? You foresaw this happening? Why didn't you do anything?\n It wasn't a premonition. I fought it there.\nI don't understand. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that it's still out there. It could come back at any time or attack someplace else.\n I don't know why it left. It seemed drawn somewhere more important to it.\nWhere? Did Mordremoth call it back? Where did it go?\n I'm sorry. I don't know. But, I suspect we'll find out in due time.\n(Otherwise)\n It was one of Mordremoth's creatures.\nIt came to hurt the Pale Tree. But, why did it leave? If it had stayed, it could have killed her.\n It may already have. She's seriously injured.\nI don't understand. Why did it leave? Are we going after it? What if it comes back?\n We don't know where it went. If it returns, the wardens will be ready.\nI wish we knew more. I have a bad feeling that this isn't the last we've seen of that beast.\n I know what you mean.\nTaimi: That was a dragon. A real dragon. I'm at a loss for words. A dragon.\n I know how you feel.\nMarjory: Everyone's standing around, afraid to move, I think. They're waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n It's over now. They can all go home.\nBut we can't. We have to do something about this dragon. We have to stop it. So many are dying. Families are suffering. Homes are being destroyed.\n I know. We'll make it our number one priority. Go to the Priory. Research.\nKas and I will learn all we can about the Elder Dragons and their history. There must be something there that can help us.\n Thanks. We'll talk soon.\nRox: I'm proud of you boss. You changed the course of history today.\n We all did.\nTalking to the other NPC's around\nCanach: Looks like I'm heading off with the Pact to Fort Trinity. Her ladyship, Countess Anise, has given me my first official solo mission.\n Why Fort Trinity?\nWho can discern the true motives of a woman like Anise? Not I. Though I suspect it is because she wants regular updates about their activities.\n Try to make yourself useful while you're there, okay?\nCountess Anise: The Pale Tree, is she all right?\n Too early to tell. She's very badly wounded.\nNormally, I'd joke about how you throw a great party, but it's already falling flat in my head. Instead, I'll say that when you attract your enemies' aggression, it means you're on the right track.\n I just wish we'd mounted a stronger defense.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nIf the instance is done alone, 3 roots will spawn. If done with one other person, 4 roots will spawn. If done with a full group, 5 will spawn.\nIf the boss is not defeated after a certain number of rounds of root killing, and damaging the boss, its health will reset to full.\nIf player attempts to talk to Countess Anise at the end of the mission, on occasion Countess Anise will say the 4 quotes from the Sylvari banker in Lion's Arch.",

Do you think the Pale Tree will recover?\nWarden: Our mother is resilient, but the Mordrem tore at her in ways we don't fully understand. We know it affected her mind.\nWarden: She fades in and out of awareness, but she said she was able to protect the Dream from the assault.\nMarjory Delaqua: But, at what cost to herself?\nTalking to Marjory:\n\nMarjory Delaqua: Hey, there. I spoke with one of these sylvari, and he said the Pale Tree could wake up at any time. I'm glad you made it when you did. They've promised us to let us know if she wakes.\n Where's Kasmeer?\nShe stayed in Camp Resolve to help prepare for the launch. Rox and Braham, too. Taimi said she was going back to school, but you never know with that child.\n Good. We'll make this visit as quick as we can.\nAre you excited to tell the Pale Tree what you know about the egg?\n I am. She can perhaps help us find Caithe.\nLet's hope so. I can tell you want to find her as quickly as possible.\n Is something on your mind, Jory? You've been...quiet.\nI guess I just don't understand why this egg is so important. How is an egg going to help us take down Mordremoth? The Pact is about ready to leave...without us.\n I know killing Mordremoth means a lot to you.\nIt...killed my sister.\n I have to ask you to trust me. Mordremoth is one battle in a greater war.\nAnd you're certain this egg will help us win the war. OK, boss. I'm with you.\n I need your support, Jory. Your friendship. Thank you.\nAfter finishing the dialogue:\n\nMarjory Delaqua: Ah, someone's coming. Good news, hopefully.\nMender Aine: Friend. She's aware now, but we can never predict for how long.\nMender Aine: Follow me, please.\nApproaching the avatar:\n\nMender Aine: Mother, I've brought the Pact commander who asked to see you.\nAvatar of the Tree: Good. I was hoping to see you soon. The vision...\nTalking to the avatar:\n\nAvatar of the Tree: Have you made any progress...with it?\n I believe so. I found the egg, but...\nWhat a relief. You may have just saved Tyria. The struggle is far from over, but if you had failed to find and protect the egg, it would have been over before it began.\n So...Caithe has the egg in her custody. We're trying to find her.\nCaithe has the egg? Why? You, you're the one who must care for it. Not Caithe. That's why I gave you the vision.\n I know, but for some reason I don't understand, she ran off with it.\nOh. Well, you must find her. I can help, but my powers in this regard are...limited.\n What can we do?\nMaybe if you knew...more about her past. I can give you memory seeds. They will...allow you to search her memories for places that are significant...to her.\n Thank you.\nAine, please give <Character name> four memory seeds. They will reveal a slice of Caithe's history to you. Among those memories, you will perhaps find something that will guide you to her.\n How do I use them?\nI'll let Aine explain them to you. I am...so tired. She has all the knowledge you need. Aine, if you please.\n Thank you very much.\nAfter finishing the dialogue:\n\nMender Aine: Use the first seed...here in the Grove. It's where Caithe's roots are. Ask me if you have any other questions about them.\nTalking to Aine:\n\nMender Aine: Keep the memory seeds in a safe, dry place. They will sprout when you choose the right spots to use them.\n(If sylvari)\n These are precious, Mother. Are you sure you want to give me four?\nAvatar of the Tree: I am sure. There is nothing more important...than this mission. You must find the egg and see to its...security.\n(If Cycle of Dawn sylvari)[verification requested]\n It's been a while since I've seen one of these. Can you refresh my memory? (Same as \"How do I use them?\" below)\n(Otherwise)[verification requested]\n I've never used one. What do I do? (Same as \"How do I use them?\" below)\n Thank you, Mother. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(Otherwise)\n How do I use them?\nThe seeds are magically attuned to read your intent. If you think about Caithe, then your intuition will guide you to a place that was important to Caithe. Once you find the right spot, plant a seed.\n What will happen when I do?\nYou'll view one of Caithe's memories through her eyes. You will feel in control, but you will be Caithe. Important events will play out as they did in days gone by.\n Where do these seeds come from?\nThey come from our mother. They're highly magical and can be guided by your will to show you memories rooted in a particular location. But you must focus on your target.\n And they allow me to see other's memories?\nEvents leave impressions in the magic around us. More emotional ones can linger a long time. The seeds guide you to them.\n Do they work with anyone's memories?\nNo. Only sylvari. They're tied to Dream magic, well beyond my understanding.\n(If sylvari)\n Thank you, Mother. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(Otherwise)\n Thank you, Pale Tree. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(If sylvari)\n Thank you, Mother. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(Otherwise)\n Thank you, Pale Tree. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(If sylvari)\n Thank you, Mother. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(Otherwise)\n Thank you, Pale Tree. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(If sylvari)\n Thank you, Mother. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\n(Otherwise)\n Thank you, Pale Tree. And you, Aine. I won't waste this gift.\nTalking to Marjory:\n\nMarjory Delaqua: It must be around here somewhere, don't you think? Are you getting any feelings about it?\n Yes, I just need to keep looking.\n\n\n=== Caithe's memory ===\nUpon entering the memory:\n\nFaolain: Oh, please, Trahearne. Don't tell me you're up here contemplating the words of a long-dead centaur.\nTrahearne: I know what you think of Ventari's tablet, but I find wisdom in it.\nFaolain: Do you even consider other views? Filling the heads of this new crop with only one side doesn't seem responsible.\nTrahearne: Ventari's tenets will help them make something of themselves, my dear. All sentient beings feel that urge.\nFaolain: Exactly. To make something of themselves, not to live up to someone else's ideal of what they should be.\n(Trahearne wanders off)\nFaolain: Caithe. Can we talk for a moment?\nTalking to Faolain (cutscene):\n\nFaolain: After the gathering today, we must corner Wynne and get her to tell us what she was talking to Mother about.\nCaithe: You're obsessing again. You know how we night blooms are about our secrets.\nFaolain: This is important, Caithe. She knows something that could hold sway over all sylvari. That's not trivial.\nCaithe: (laugh) You don't know that's true. You overheard a portion of a conversation—out of context, no less.\nFaolain: I know! C'mon. We're going to be late for the gathering.\nOn the route to the meeting:\n\nFiana: The elders are meeting. What do you suppose they're going to talk about?\nNewly Awakened: I imagine they're as surprised as we are that we awoke. Do you suppose they want us gone?\nFiana: Don't be ridiculous.\nNewly Awakened (1): I tried again to talk to Ceara.\nNewly Awakened (2): Seriously, why don't you leave her be. She doesn't want company.\nNewly Awakened: Over two years. That's how long the others were here all alone, just the twelve.\nNewly Awakened: It explains why they're so intimate with one another. I wish I'd been one of them.\nCadeyrn: The elders follow without thinking. This tablet, it's a farce. They cling to it because it tells them how to behave.\nCadeyrn: But we, we have our own minds. We do not swallow whole the old philosophies. We...are better than that.\nCadeyrn: Can you meet tomorrow night to discuss the tablet? Midnight.\nFaolain: Hm. I'll be there. It'll be good to speak with others of a similar mind.\nTalking to the secondborn:\n\nCeara: What? Huh? This better be important. I was on the edge of understanding this device.\n I was just curious. What is that?\nI don't know. I found it in the woods beyond Mother's roots. I'm taking it apart to see if I can figure out how it works. It's absolutely fascinating.\n Don't let me interrupt, then. Good day.\nCadeyrn: Some of us are meeting tomorrow evening to discuss the tenets of Ventari's tablet. They don't resonate with all of us. You are welcome to attend. Faolain has said she will be there.\n What do you have against the tenets?\nI've only been awake for a few months, but I can already tell that the tenets don't cover all facets of the vast nature of life. They are too...idealistic.\n So? Just ignore them if you don't like them.\nHow can we? Trahearne and some of the other elders—even our own mother—force them down our throats every day. No one will listen to counterarguments. They expect us to just fall into step.\n The blossom is brother to the weed—a tenet that seems to apply here.\n I'll pass, thanks.\nApproaching the meeting:\n\nWynne: Thank you all for coming. We're here to discuss our newly awakened and how we can best assist them.\nFaolain: You say assist, but you mean mold. You want to make them all into your version of good little sylvari.\nTrahearne: No. As firstborn, it is our responsibility to care for and guide these...secondborn.\nWynne: The newly awakened—let's not call them \"secondborn\"—could benefit from our knowledge of Ventari's tenets.\nFaolain: Oh, please.\nChatter in the background:\n\nNewborn (1): I'd love to be an ant at their feet—to hear what they're saying.\nNewborn (2): There they go again. Probably talking about us.\nNewborn (3): Why aren't we involved in their discussions?\nTalking to Faolain without talking to the others:\n\nFaolain: This is a waste of time. These newly awakened don't need to be coddled. We didn't need anyone holding our hands or indoctrinating us with unexamined philosophies.\n But they're not us. Maybe Wynne is right. Maybe we should—\nIf we do anything, we should encourage them to think for themselves, depend on themselves. Besides, Wynne can't be trusted. She keeps secrets from us.\n That is true. She does seem to be hiding something.\nTrahearne: If Wynne knows something of import, she will tell us. But let's not change the subject, please. We're discussing the secondborn.\n Are we officially calling them secondborn, then?\nWynne: That's a terrible name for them, Trahearne. And thus, we make official chasm between them and us. We are all just sylvari.\n We did awaken first, though.\n I want to hear what the others have to say before we adjourn.\n I want to talk with the others before we adjourn.\nTalking to the other firstborn:\n\nTrahearne: Knowledge is central to happiness and long life. We have experienced more of the world than these newly awakened. They endanger themselves without realizing it.\n Predators will prey.\nCaithe, I'm aware of no creature in this world that doesn't defend its young from predators. Perhaps not always successfully, but often to the point of their own death.\n Are we creatures? Do we know that for sure?\nI am a thinking, feeling being—as are you. There's never been a race like ours. We're unique, undoubtedly formed to do great things. But we're also vulnerable.\n You think too much, Trahearne.\nThe ability to think is the prelude to free will. We are young, and there are many dangers out there. If we don't all work together, one strong enemy or illness could wipe us out completely.\n What a horror if our race ceased to exist. We've worked so hard to survive.\nKeep that thought close to your heart, Caithe. It will guide you, all your life, to do the right thing by our people.\n I'll keep it in mind.\n Perhaps you're right.\nNiamh: I believe these new sprouts can be leveraged to improve life in the Grove. We are not safe until we take our own defense seriously. We need wardens to guard us.\n It would keep them busy and hopefully out of trouble.\nI feel called to make our home safe. I plan to organize a protective force for us, and I'll ask the sprouts to volunteer for it.\n You do that. As for me, my Wyld Hunt will likely take me away from here.\nLast I heard, the exact nature of your Wyld Hunt was still mysterious. Have you had insight into what you're being called to do?\n Not exactly. But it's linked to dragons. I'll know when the moment comes.\n I suppose that makes sense.\nMalomedies: We went so long without losing one of our own, but first Riannoc and now three of our newly awakened have been killed already. This is unacceptable.\n This is life, Malomedies. At least now we know that we can die.\nI worry about the others. What if they never return?\n Many will leave the Grove before all is said and done. We cannot stop them.\nKahedins: I try to find time to help each of the new sprouts interpret their Dreams, but it's becoming difficult with so many awakening. I fear some will go astray and misinterpret their Wyld Hunts.\n Is it possible to misinterpret your Wyld Hunt? That's worth considering.\nDagonet: It's been several months now since the first new sprouts began to appear. They're awakening at an increasingly steady pace. If it doesn't stop soon...\n We'll be overrun.\nWynne: I don't understand how anyone can be indifferent to our own kind. We are so few and so fragile. Trying too hard to be noble...and good. We must rely on and support one another. No matter what.\n She's not being indifferent. She simply believes in the freedom to choose.\nWe all do. But what harm is there in teaching which path is better. We know more. We've been here longer.\n Not so much longer that we can know what's right for others, for them.\nAife: It's fascinating how the new sprouts take in the world. I remember feeling and thinking as they do. Perhaps they could do as well as we did.\n Maybe even better. But that's not the point.\nFaolain: So much talking. Maybe we just all need to agree that we do the best for them that we can. Aiming for perfection leads only to certain failure.\n You make a good point.\n I want to talk with the others before we adjourn.\nAfter finishing talking:\n\nFaolain: Don't look at me that way, Wynne. You know I'm right. Whatever your secret is, I'll dig it out of you.\nWynne: I have no secret. You know everything I know.\nFaolain: Don't lie to me. I heard you whispering to Mother.\nFaolain: I heard you say there was something that could give unspeakable power over all sylvari. What were you talking about?\nWynne: I have to go. I'm traveling to a centaur refuge in the Silverwastes to research Ventari. We'll talk later, Faolain.\nNewly Awakened: Elders! I bring grave news. Please, listen!\nTalking to the scout (cutscene):\n\nCaithe: Take a deep breath, sapling. What's your hurry?\nNewly Awakened: Small imp-like creatures. We just wanted to explore beyond Mother's roots. They appeared out of nowhere!\nTrahearne: Asura, I'd guess. Malomedies had an...encounter with them not long ago. He was lucky to survive.\nTrahearne: Where did they go?\nNewly Awakened: They took them northwest into the forest. I followed them awhile, but then I felt I should come get help.\nNewly Awakened: They said something about returning to \"Metrica\" before I lost their trail.\nTrahearne: Caithe, Faolain, you two had the most experience in the wild. Would you scout ahead?\nTrahearne: The secondborn are precious. We cannot allow them to be killed to assuage some ignorant race's curiosity.\nFaolain: At last, something we can agree on, Trahearne.\nFaolain: I can't wait to teach these imps a lesson. You and me, together.\nCaithe: We'll rescue as many as we can. They treated Malomedies terribly. I hope they're not so harsh with this group.\nFaolain: They're going to remember the day they met the two of us!\n\n\n=== Back in the reality ===\nTalking to Marjory:\n\nMarjory Delaqua: What happened? What did you see?\n(If sylvari)\n I was Caithe, in my race's early years. I saw Faolain and Trahearne.\n(Otherwise)\n I was Caithe, more than twenty years ago. Faolain and Trahearne were there.\nThe leader of the Nightmare Court? It must have been fascinating to hear how they interacted back then. I'm jealous. But did you learn anything that will help us find Caithe?\n(If sylvari)\n To see them so young...it was incredible. They went to Metrica.\nMetrica Province? That area is populated with asura. Why are they going there?\n They were tracking some \"imps\" that had kidnapped a group of secondborn. (same as \"They were heading into Metrica. \"Imps\" had kidnapped secondborn.\" below)\n(If charr)\n You know Metrica well?\nMetrica Province? That area is populated with asura. Why are they going there?\n They were tracking some \"imps\" that had kidnapped a group of secondborn. (same as \"They were heading into Metrica. \"Imps\" had kidnapped secondborn.\" below)\n(If norn)\n It was like watching young deer play. And they mentioned Metrica.\nMetrica Province? That area is populated with asura. Why are they going there?\n They were tracking some \"imps\" that had kidnapped a group of secondborn. (same as \"They were heading into Metrica. \"Imps\" had kidnapped secondborn.\" below)\n(If human)\n I saw their destination: Metrica.\nMetrica Province? That area is populated with asura. Why are they going there?\n They were tracking some \"imps\" that had kidnapped a group of secondborn. (same as \"They were heading into Metrica. \"Imps\" had kidnapped secondborn.\" below)\n(Otherwise)\n They were heading into Metrica. \"Imps\" had kidnapped secondborn.\nImps? All right. Rox is expecting me for a sword practice. I'd better let her know I won't be there. It won't take long. I'll meet you there.\n Good plan. Be careful.\n How is Rox with the greatsword? I've never seen her fight with one.\nShe's surprisingly good, though she says it isn't her weapon of choice. She learned when she was in school, and she knows a ton about battle stances. I'm learning a lot. I plan to keep at it.\n Good plan. Be careful.\nTalking to your available allies:\n\nMarjory Delaqua: I'll see you in Metrica Province, boss.\n See you there.\nMender Aine: Please, I'd ask that you let our mother rest now. Good luck finding the memories. Do you know what your next destination is?\n They mentioned they were heading into Metrica Province. Thanks again.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nOther party members will be under the  Memory Presence effect during the memory vision.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nOriginally, the dialogue with Malomedies said that Riannoc's fate was unknown at the time of Caithe's memory. This conflicted with the knowledge of his death predating Malomedies being experimented on, and was rectified in a later update.",

You will have to deal with the security golems and ballistic cannons that will now attack you, but they aren't too hard to take down.\n\nContinue on to where the Veteran Chak Blitzer spawns, along with various other chak.You only need to take out the Chak Blitzer to continue. \nAfter going through the re-activated asura gate, you will be given a Mastery Point, though the mission will not be over.\nIn the room with all of the chak, kill or keep them away from Taimi until she has the laser up. Then carefully lure the Chak into the laser. Be careful not to stand in front of the laser yourself. Using swiftness/super speed buffs on Taimi can help speed up this section.\nA few chak may be left after the laser is done. Clear them out and continue into the next room to conclude the instance.\nAfter the mission is complete, you will spawn back in the open world tunnels, so be careful of nearby wandering chak.  \n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nAvailable from first play through\n\nComplete the story chapter\n\nThis achievement does not need to be done in one playthrough and can be completed over multiple runs. There are 32 security devices that need to be disabled in total:\n\n4 security golems\n28 Ballistic Cannons\nThe security golems and initial cannons can be found as you progress the story line. The remaining cannons can be destroyed by going around the roughly circular path centered on the Rata Novus Waypoint (blue circles on the image), including the 4 cannons in the water under the  Rata Novus Perimeter —  (green on the image) and the 4 cannons along the path you started from.\n\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Qualify for Cleaning House effect.\n\nThe wounded Mordrem guard can be found to the north of the instance entry area.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Qualify for An Ignoble End effect.\nThe wounded Mordrem guard will disappear if you progress the story instance further.\nAvailable on subsequent visits\n\nThere are two notes that must be obtained to complete this achievement:\n\nThe Waterlogged Note - found underwater, west of the first set of power supplies that Taimi turns on, in the very deep shaft with four underwater turrets.\nThe Printed Schematic - found in the Rata Novus Command Center, a small distance from the old asura gate at a nearby console.\nA third note can be found in a Derelict Sentry Golem, but it is not necessary for solving the code.\nAfter finding the above notes, simply wait until the end of the instance where your party has reached the Dragon Research Lab. Look for the Rata Novan Terminal and input \"01172\". Note that there is a \"1\" already input for you, making the complete code \"101172\". From there, enter the portal to get the achievement.\n\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Qualify for New Horizons effect.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nTaimi\nGolem\nScruffy\nNorn\nBraham Eirsson\nMordrem\nMordrem Guard Punisher (turns hostile for the event for achievement)\nSylvari\nCanach\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nChak\nChak Bracer\nChak Drone\nChak Lurker\nChak Slinger\nChak Zapper\nVeteran Chak Blitzer\nVeteran Chak Lurker\nVeteran Chak Slinger\nGolem\nSentry Golem\nMordrem\nMordrem Guard Punisher\n\n\n== Objects ==\nBallistic Cannon\nDerelict Sentry Golem\nInterior Ballistic Cannon\nPrinted Pages\nRata Novan Console\nRata Novan Terminal\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nInitial cinematic:\n\n<Character name>: We should get moving. Where's Taimi?\nBraham Eirsson: I told her not to, but she wandered off to study some old tech she said looked \"fantastically intriguing.\"\n<Character name>: Time is of the essence, but we can't leave her here alone.\nTaimi: Wait! Guys! I'm here! Don't get your feathers in such a ruffle. I'm fine!\n(continues without cinematic)\nBraham Eirsson: Well, we don't have time to wait here while you play with some new toys.\nBraham Eirsson: That dragon's not going to sit around while we find this Rata Novan research.\n<Character name>: It's okay. But we can't delay any longer.\nMaking your way into Rata Novus:\n\n<Character name>: Tizlak was right. The city appears long dead. I guess we won't find any allies to rally for our cause.\nTaimi: Such a pity. All those asura.\nBraham Eirsson: Maybe no new allies, but there is something else here. I'm picking up some prints that are definitely not asura. Looks like they belong to...\n(Chak spawn)\n<Character name>: Chak?\nBraham Eirsson: Yeah, how did you...? Ah. Gotcha.\nTaimi: Makes sense the chak are here. This place is a nexus for ley energy. I speculate these things actually channel it somehow.\n<Character name>: Great, well-fed chak. They're probably responsible for the death of this entire city.\nCanach: Luckily you can withdraw into the safety of your golem. This is obviously no place for an asura.\nTaimi: Safety of my golem? What's that supposed to mean? Maybe you need the safety of my golem!\nCanach: What? I'm not saying it, nature is.\n<Character name>: Okay, enough. Let's pick up the pace.\n<Character name>: We need to find the lab where they conducted their dragon research. What's the best way to do that?\nTaimi: Maybe if we power up the city, Scruffy could trace the biggest energy draw. Logically, it should be the hub of their research.\n<Character name>: Sounds reasonable. How do you restore power to this place?\nTaimi: That's what I was investigating before you got here—not playing with toys, Braham...\nTaimi: Anyway, they had a different procedure for refining ley energy and using it for power.\n<Character name>: Impressive.\nTaimi: This thing's an off-line ley collector.\nTaimi: We could manually turn enough of them on to get the juice flowing, but the chak will notice and come running.\n<Character name>: It's worth the risk. Get it started.\nWhile fighting chak and defending Taimi:\n\nBraham Eirsson: Glad these chak are enough of a challenge to keep me sharp for Mordremoth.\nTaimi: I've got good news for you if you're itching for a fight.\nTaimi: The more of these we turn on, the more chak they'll attract. So yeah... Math! Deadly math!\n<Character name>: Just keep doing your thing, Taimi. We'll take care of whatever comes.\nTaimi: C'mon, you stupid—\nTaimi: There! Finally.\nBraham Eirsson: How much longer, Taimi?\nTaimi: Still multiple collectors left before the city turns on.\nCanach: If the power is down, where's this light coming from?\nTaimi: I wondered the same thing! And the Rata Novans had quite an answer!\nTaimi: The fixtures above us are actually clusters of optic cables that run up to the surface.\nTaimi: They carry natural light down below. No power needed.\n<Character name>: All the way down here, and you still get daylight.\nTaimi: It's ingenious! I hope we get to see how they solved one of the underground ventilation problems.\nTaimi: It could revolutionize all future asuran construction!\n<Character name>: We won't find it here. On to the next one.\nif sylvari:\n<Character name>: Canach, is it just me, or is the call quieter down here?\nCanach: I noted that as well. Mordremoth's voice was growing to a great bellow as we drew closer.\nCanach: Here, it's a whisper. It's a welcome respite.\n<Character name>: Was it becoming too much for you?\nCanach: Was it for you?\n<Character name>: No. My resolve is stronger than that.\nCanach: Mine as well.\notherwise:\n<Character name>: You're unusually silent, Canach. Is the call distracting you?\nCanach: It's actually quite the opposite. It's... quiet down here.\nCanach: Mordremoth's voice was growing to a great bellow as we drew closer. Here, it's a whisper. It's a welcome respite.\n<Character name>: Was it becoming too much?\nCanach: Commander, you insult me. I have no plans to give myself over to that beast.\n<Character name>: Good to hear.\nTaimi: Just a few more and we'll have enough power to get any of the surviving systems up and running.\n<Character name>: And from there?\nTaimi: Scruffy will allow me to track where all this power is headed.\n<Character name>: Good. We find a lab. With any luck, we find their dragon data. Let's get the last one going.\nTaimi: Hold up, hold up! Scruffy's picking up some unusual readings.\nTaimi: It looks like... It's a golem signature; old-fashioned, but different than anything I've seen before.\nBraham Eirsson: Does that mean...?\nTaimi: We must have powered up the city enough to turn on its defenses. And then we triggered said defenses. Yay, us.\n<Character name>: Heads up, everyone. Sounds like asuran tech incoming.\nCanach: The chak's connection to ley energy is curious. I wonder if it could be employed against Mordremoth.\nBraham Eirsson: Going after the Rata Novan research is one thing. We can't waste time studying them now.\nTaimi: Braham, no one has ever wasted time studying.\n<Character name>: Let's stay on course. Which way, Taimi?\nTaimi: Now that we started the engine, I'm getting a sizable power signature—might be a lab. Follow me and the big guy!\nSentry Golem dialogues:\n\nCivic—pride—poll—initiated: What—should—the—city—slogan—be? Thank—you—for—participating.

Sorry, guys, the signal just moved.\nTaimi: I guess the ley equipment on Scruffy's not quite perfected yet.\n<Character name>: It's fine. Let's keep moving before we run into more trouble.\n<Character name>: How's it working now, Taimi? We back on track?\nTaimi: I think so. We're almost right on top of the source!\nCanach: Is that...?\nTaimi: An asura gate! Dissimilar in design, but probably similar in function.\nBraham Eirsson: Is it active? Why isn't it glowing if we turned on the power?\nTaimi: Good question. Let me see.\nTaimi: Uh, okay. Good news, bad news. Good news is there's enough power to turn this gate on.\nTaimi: Bad news is, something's interrupting the flow. Something...big.\n(Veteran Chak Blitzer spawns)\nBraham Eirsson: I think we found the culprit.\nCinematic after defeating the Chak Blitzer:\n\nCanach: Braham!\nTaimi: Move! Go! Go!\nAfter cinematic:\n\n<Character name>: Nice job, Taimi.\nTaimi: Thanks, but Scruffy did most of the work.\n<Character name>: Yeah, well, he's as much a part of the team as you.\nTaimi: I guess so. Sure...\nCanach: The gate's up. Where do you think it goes? Rata Sum?\nTaimi: As far as I know, they were never connected. It must lead deeper into this complex. We should test it out; make sure it's safe.\n<Character name>: How do we do that?\nTaimi: Someone just walks into it, and if they're not obliterated, it works! Who wants to try?\nif asura:\n<Character name>: I suppose I'll be your test subject.\nif charr:\n<Character name>: Fine. It's on me then!\nif norn:\n<Character name>: Guess it's up to me.\nif human:\n<Character name>: I suppose I'll go.\nif sylvari:\n<Character name>: I suppose I'll try it.\nOptional: Check in with Taimi\n\n<Character name>: Is everything okay, Taimi?\nTaimi: Sorry. Yes. I'm okay, Commander... Well, actually... Permission to speak freely?\n<Character name>: Always. What is it?\nTaimi: I enjoy serving in this company; everyone is great, but I'm a member of this team, not its mascot.\n<Character name>: I agree. You've more than proved your mettle during this mission.\nTaimi: Oh! You do? Well, I wish everyone else felt that way.\n<Character name>: I think they do. Hate to break it to you, but you're a full-fledged part of this team whether you like it or not.\nTaimi: Okay. I'll take your word for it. Thanks.\nCinematic after walking through the portal:\n\nTaimi: Great job not dying, Commander! I told you that gate would—\nAfter cinematic:\n\nTaimi: I hope no one was planning on going back that way...\n<Character name>: Where'd we end up?\nTaimi: There's a huge ley draw ahead of us. I'd bet my transverse wave inverter it's the dragon lab.\nCinematic:\n\nBraham Eirsson: Wolf's fang!\nCanach: We appear to be outnumbered.\nTaimi: This isn't a lab to them. It's a dining hall.\n<Character name>: Wait. The emblem on that blast door.\nTaimi: A dragon! That must be it!\nDiscovering a way to open the door:\n\n<Character name>: We need to get through that mess and open that lab.\nCanach: We can't. The door that leads down those stairs is dead.\nBraham Eirsson: So, we're trapped here? The only other way out was through the gate that just exploded?\nTaimi: Maybe? Probably. Yes.\n<Character name>: Let's think about this... Why aren't those doors working?\nTaimi: Oh! Hold on...\nTaimi: Ley energy powers this whole place, and this ley conduit is blown.\nTaimi: It almost certainly rendered the doors to this room and the lab inoperative when it went.\nTaimi: If we can complete the circuit, they'll both open for sure!\n<Character name>: Any ideas, people?\nTaimi: I have a thought. Scruffy can bridge the gap. The ley tech I outfitted him with should conduct the energy.\n<Character name>: But... will he survive?\nTaimi: Well, I'm not sure...\n<Character name>: Taimi, back at Dry Top when the Inquest destroyed Scruffy and almost captured you... I can't—\nTaimi: You can't what? Let a child make her own decisions? I'm not a child and this is what I'm doing.\nTaimi: Maybe I wasn't ready for it at Dry Top, but I'm ready now.\n<Character name>: Fair enough. But once the doors are open, we'll still have a ton of chak to contend with.\nTaimi: I have an idea for that too, but first things first.\nCinematic:\n\nTaimi: All right, big guy, it's time. You know what to do.\nBraham Eirsson: Why did he stop?\nTaimi: Go on. It's okay. I'll be okay.\nAfter cinematic:\n\n<Character name>: Thank you, Taimi.\n<Character name>: Now about those chak.\nCanach: Yes, we're devastatingly outnumbered.\nTaimi: Commander, when you were young, do you remember the bad kids burning beetles with a magnifying lens?\nIf sylvari:\n<Character name>: I've heard stories. Why?\nIf not sylvari:\n<Character name>: Sure. Why?\nTaimi: Because I'm about to be bad.\nTaimi: The device in that room is basically a huge telescope.\nTaimi: I can reconfigure all the lights in there to feed into the lenses, turning it into a giant heat ray!\nBraham Eirsson: And then we have ourselves a chak cookout. Brilliant.\n<Character name>: Do what you need to. We'll back you up.\nTaimi: Okay... Here we go.\nDuring the fights:\n\nTaimi: Outta the way, chak!\n<Character name>: Fend them off until she's done!\nTaimi: (screams) Commander!\n<Character name>: It's okay, Taimi. We're right here!\nTaimi: I've positioned the lenses on the microscope. Have to get to that console now!\n<Character name>: Move!\n<Character name>: What next?\nTaimi: Hold on... Get your crawly legs off of— Focusing all the light clusters in this room into one point!\n<Character name>: C'mon!\nTaimi: Almost there!\nBraham Eirsson: Commander!\nCanach: Taimi, I can't keep them away forev—\nTaimi: Got it! Watch out!\n<Character name>: Now what?\nTaimi: Over here, Commander! Lure them over this way!\nAfter the heat ray is turned on:\n\nTaimi: Draw the chak into the path of my beam!\nTaimi: Yes!\nBraham Eirsson: That... was amazing.\nCanach: It smells better than I would have imagined too.\nIn the Dragon Research Lab:\n\n<Character name>: Is this it? Is this the right place?\nTaimi: Boot up these machines and we'll find out.\nAfter turning on the computers:\n\nTaimi: Whoa, these Rata Novans had a serious beef against Primordus\n<Character name>: Anything on Mordremoth?\nTaimi: No. Well... Sort of. It's about all the Elder Dragons.\nCanach: What is it?\nTaimi: Based on their extensive research on Primordus, the Rata Novans determined that each Elder Dragon had a weakness.\nTaimi: A unique respective weakness.\nBraham Eirsson: And does it say...?\nTaimi: What it is? No.\nBraham Eirsson: (sigh) How easily the fleet went down; it's obvious the way you and my mother stopped Zhaitan won't work here.\nBraham Eirsson: So what do we do now?\n<Character name>: This is good news, people.\n<Character name>: We've been charging headlong against Mordremoth not even knowing if it can be beaten, only knowing we had to beat it.\n<Character name>: Now we know it's possible. Our mission is to find out how.\n<Character name>: To do that we have to get closer to Mordremoth. And thanks to that ley map, we know exactly where it is.\nBraham Eirsson: Let's catch up with the others, then. I suppose it'd be nice to have some help finding this weakness.\n<Character name>: Thanks for everything, Taimi. So, does this mean no more Scruffy?\nTaimi: Oh, no. I already have design plans for Scruffy two-point-zero!\nTaimi: Little trim here, little tuck there, and weapons—lots of weapons.\nTaimi: But no golem for the immediate future means this is the end of the road for me.\nTaimi: I'll be staying in Rata Novus with all this delectable research—bummer!\n<Character name>: Alone? Are you sure?\nTaimi: Hey, would you ask Rytlock if he was sure? Canach?\n<Character name>: Point taken. Should I send word to someone back at Rata Sum, let them know you're here?\nTaimi: Uh... No, thanks. I'll take care of that...in, like, a few weeks or so.\n<Character name>: Don't want to get Phlunted again, huh?\nTaimi: Not particularly.\n<Character name>: (laugh) Okay, Taimi. I hope to see you soon.\nTaimi: Me too, Commander. Give that dragon a good one for me.\n\n\n=== Related to achievement objectives ===\nApproaching the lone Mordrem Guard Punisher (part of the \"An Ignoble End\" achievement):\n\nCanach: Is that—? A traitorous sylvari somehow made it into Rata Novus. Alone.\nBraham Eirsson: Big deal. It'll fall just like the rest.\nCanach: Wait. He doesn't appear hostile. More...confused.\nTaimi: Your point being?\nCanach: The call is quieter here. Maybe this one sought refuge.

      "strWikiText": "Dragon's Stand is an explorable zone located to the south of Tangled Depths. It is the deepest part of the Heart of Maguuma region. The Pact have set up a base on the outskirts, ready to engage in a zone-wide push into the Dragon's Domain. They face heavy resistance from swarms of Mordrem, elite Commanders, and the Mouth of Mordremoth, the Elder Dragon's physical form.\nPlaying through this map by doing the events and opening the Noxious Pods with Machetes is the primary way to obtain Leystone armor.\nThis map is all about its meta event, which starts every 2 hours. A map that is not doing its meta event will be mostly inactive. Players that wish to participate in this meta event, and/or completely discover all of this map, are advised to enter the map a few minutes before the meta event starts and check for groups in LFG. Several areas of the map are completely closed to players and only open by progressing the meta event.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nDragon's Stand can only be reached from Tangled Depths - either from the portal south of the Dragon's Passage or by going through the portal south of the Ley-Line Confluence that opens up once the Chak Gerent meta event has been completed.\n\n\n== Map completion ==\n  Barbed Thorn (30)\n  Gift of the Jungle\nOne of the following, depending on your profession:\n   Guardian's Cache\n   Revenant's Cache\n   Warrior's Cache\n   Engineer's Cache\n   Ranger's Cache\n   Thief's Cache\n   Elementalist's Cache\n   Mesmer's Cache\n   Necromancer's Cache\nChance at one of the following:\n  Transmutation Charge\n  Black Lion Chest Key\n\n\n== Locations ==\nUpon entering the Dragon's Stand, characters automatically discover all the Waypoints in the area. Most of them remain contested until the meta event has reached that stage.\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Advancing on the Blighting Towers ===\nOrientation\nThere is a map-wide meta event involving killing Mordremoth's commanders and pushing the Mordrem back into his territory. If the meta event is not completed within the 2 hour time limit, Mordremoth blasts the entire map, killing and pushing everyone back to the Pact Base Camp on the north-east edge of the map, while also wiping all progress made by the events across its domain. Destroying all three Blighting Towers results in the timer being paused, allowing the final battle to take place without the pressure of a timer.\n\nPreparation\nThere are three lanes (north, middle and south), each with their own chain of events leading the Pact towards one of three Blighting Towers. The Pact must gather equipment and allied forces along the way, while destroying Mordrem Spitfires and claiming their locations as forward encampments. At the start of the meta event, and after taking each one of the forward camps, 2 events will occur per lane. By quickly clearing these events, the push can be much faster. Noxious Pods will also spawn at each base claimed, with additional pods spawned for each of the bonus events successfully cleared.\nAfter claiming the first Spitfire in a lane, that lane's respective Legendary Mordrem Commander will spawn near their Gate to the Blighted Towers, and begin slowly marching towards the Pact convoy. These Legendary enemies will delay the escort and preparatory events alike, so engaging them in battle before they disrupt the push is crucial. These will respawn periodically.\n\nNorth - Adryn, the Stavemaster\nMiddle - Diarmid, the Blademaster\nSouth - Hareth, the Axemaster\nThe Blighting Towers\nAll three lanes must reach the gates to begin the tower phase.\nWhen the gates open, each lane will enter a room with a boss in the center. The boss is invincible unless all three Ley Line Harvesting pods are destroyed. After all pods are destroyed, the Veteran Mordrem Preservers which keep spawning around the room (90 seconds after the last one was defeated) need to be taken out continuously. If they are allowed to reach the center, they will heal the pods or spawn them. If a pod spawns, the boss becomes invincible again. If the boss is already defeated when a pod spawns, it is revived. All three Legendary Commanders must be dead simultaneously for map events to continue.\nThe usual tactic for this part of the meta event is to use two commanders and groups on each tower, one commander squad with 10 members, and the other commander squad with the rest. The larger squad runs continuously around the tower destroying the pods and defeating the three preservers (as they respawn), while the smaller squad engages the Legendary Mordrem Commander in the center. Speed Boost Mushrooms and Adrenal Mushrooms are available in the center area, greatly boosting the boss' defeat if used well.\n\nNorthern Assault\n [Group Event] Gather around Tactician Jazmei for a head count (80)\n  Bring Chakata shiny wyvern crystals to get the skritt to join the fight (80) \n  Glide up to gather Mordrem vine pods and return them to Briallen (80) \n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Mordrem spitfire (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the Mordrem Spitfire (80)\n  Defend the planted mushrooms until they reach maturity (80) \n  Bring meat from the saurian nests to build a pile to attract wyverns (80) \n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Mordrem spitfire (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the Mordrem Spitfire (80)\n  Help Gammalon Vineripper destroy the brambles and clear a path to the Exalted (80)\n  Help Spleecta turn the Exalted machine back on (80)\n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Northern Barbed Gate (80)\n [Group Event] Hold the area while the Pact prepares to breach the gate (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat Mordremoth's Commander (80) \n [Group Event] Stavemaster Adryn approaches (80)\nDefend the camp (Dragon's Stand)\nCentral Assault\n [Group Event] Gather around Tactician Dutch for a head count (80)\n  Retrieve engine parts to keep the cannons online (80)\n  Help Grumlukl create his bombs (80)\n  Defeat the mushrooms to rescue the trapped Itzel (80) (80)\n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Mordrem spitfire (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the Mordrem Spitfire (80)\n  Toss salvaged scrap to Overseer Braeden so that he can build barricades (80)\n  Destroy the Mordrem prisons and get the soldiers to their chopper alive (80) \n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Mordrem spitfire (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the Mordrem Spitfire (80)\n  Climb up and retrieve the flamethrower supplies (80) \n  Defend Alara the Wolf as she builds turrets (80)\n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Central Barbed Gate (80)\n [Group Event] Hold the area while the Pact prepares to breach the gate (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat Mordremoth's commander (80) \n [Group Event] Blademaster Diarmid Approaches (80)\nDefend the camp (Dragon's Stand)\nSouthern Assault\n [Group Event] Gather around Tactician Ranara for a head count (80)\n  Defend Splort as he activates lasers (80) \n  Destroy ley-line collectors to gather energy for the Rata Novus device (80)\n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Mordrem spitfire (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the Mordrem Spitfire (80)\n  Escort Dolyak to the camp before the assault (80)\n  Kill the chak preventing the pets from returning to their ogre masters (80) \n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Mordrem spitfire (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the Mordrem Spitfire (80)\n  Protect Skeln Razorfist while he builds thumpers (80)\n  Calm angry beetles down by stomping nodules inside the chak nest (80)\n [Group Event] Escort troops to the Southern Barbed Gate (80)\n [Group Event] Hold the area while the Pact prepares to breach the gate (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat Axemaster Hareth (80) \n [Group Event] Axemaster Hareth approaches (80)\nDefend the camp (Dragon's Stand)\n\n\n=== Dragon's Stand (meta event) ===\nAfter defeating the three commanders, the timer is stopped, and the Dragon's Domain becomes available to enter. The Updraft Use mastery is required to navigate this area; any further Gliding masteries will help the process. In particular, Ley Line Gliding makes navigation much easier as the islands are directly connected by these channels.\nSoon afterwards, the Mouth of Mordremoth attacks. To achieve success, groups must split their numbers across each island. The Mouth or a section of its body will attack islands at random and expose itself to attacks. Using control effects when the breakbar is active is recommended as this will prevent Mordremoth from eating the island (if this happens, anticipate having to glide away). Soon after passing a 25% health mark, Mordremoth's commanders will appear on three of the islands, two of them (Diarmid and Hareth's islands) will be wrapped around by Mordremoth's body and if they are not killed within a timer, those two islands will be destroyed; Adryn gives buffs to the two other commanders, requiring his death as well.\nThe primary source of damage in this fight comes from the mortar shells, which can be taken from a fallen Pact chopper that spawns periodically. The majority of the characters present should collect these mortars and make their way to the Mouth of Mordremoth's head. A smaller group should attack the head directly, using control skills at a slow pace. This will keep the head from destroying the island, and buy as much time as possible for the mortars to arrive. After the initial mortar shell phase, a Legendary Mordrem Wyvern arrives to attack islands with its Flame Trail attack, leaving line AoEs across the island which deal a large amount of damage,  Burning, and  Crippled.\n\n  Attack the Mouth of Mordremoth's head while evading its attacks (80)\n  Attack the dragon's body while evading its attacks (80)\nAfter these two simultaneous events, the following event cycle repeats until groups either succeed or fail the   Dragon's Stand (80) meta event:\n\n  Attack the Mouth of Mordremoth's head while evading its attacks (80)\n  Attack the dragon's body while evading its attacks (80)\n  Destroy the Ley-Line Disruption Pod to restore the ley lines to other islands (80)\n  Stun the Mouth of Mordremoth to keep it in place while your allies collect mortars to damage it from above (80)\n  Attack the Mouth of Mordremoth's head while evading its attacks (80)\n  Attack the dragon's body while evading its attacks (80)\n  Destroy the vine growth before it destroys a section of the island (80)\n  Defeat and stop the Mordrem commander from growing enough explosive pustules to destroy the island (80)\n  Defeat and stop the Mordrem commander from shielding allies inside the coils (80)\n  Attack the Mouth of Mordremoth's head while evading its attacks (80)\n  Attack the dragon's body while evading its attacks (80)\n  Destroy the vine growth before it destroys a section of the island (80)\nReturn to beginning of cycle\nExplore newly opened areas\nUpon defeating the Mouth of Mordremoth, a cinematic will play showing its death - after which one can glide into the updrafts to the reward chest atop the tree, where one can also find a Crystalline Ore Collector vendor.\nAfter the Mouth of Mordremoth is defeated, special areas on the map will be opened containing Noxious Pods that are opened using Machetes. There are multiple \"secret sections\" like this that are open only on mapwide victory. Red arrows on the map will hint at where the secret passage to these \"hidden\" sections containing the pods are (the only source for Crystalline Ore in the game apart from personal story rewards). During this period, Rangers can find and charm 2 pets available only on this map, the Juvenile Tiger and Juvenile Electric Wyvern. The Juvenile Tiger can also be found in Draconis Mons, at Mariner Landing.\n\n [Group Event] Find and slay the treasure mushroom! (80)\nSearch the area around the fallen dragon for treasure!\n  Kill the mushroom emperor (80)\n  Kill the spider queen (80)\n  Kill the stonehead (80)\n  Kill the wyvern (80)\n\n\n== Pets ==\nJuvenile Electric Wyvern\nWyvern Nest\nJuvenile Tiger\nNorthern Barbed Gate\n\n\n== Notes ==\nDeserted Coast and Thorn Hollow were formerly listed in the Dragon's Stand Explorer achievement, despite never having been accessible in-game.\nThere is an end of the world that can be reached from Chak Nest. This end of the world doesn't trigger any message when reached.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIt is possible to view the Asuran city of Rata Sum in the distance from using bouncing mushrooms in Exhumed Delve by the Second Southern Checkpoint. Doing so will grant the Sum Viewer achievement.",

These magical beings are sworn to protect Glint's legacy, and stand with the Pact against the encroaching threat of Mordremoth.\nOutside the city are four camps, Northwatch, Eastwatch, Southwatch, and Westwatch. The Exalted are under attack in all directions from the Mordrem, and events in the area revolve around building up these outposts, charging magical pylons, and retrieving enchanted armor. These culminate with the defense of Tarir from the Mordrem Octovine.\nExalted masteries are particularly useful here as they allow for easy navigation using the Exalted portals.

It is also home to the Nuhoch hylek tribe, and the location of the lost asuran city of Rata Novus.\nThe area contains many Nuhoch Wallows that allow fast travel like Skritt Holes, but they require the Nuhoch Wallows mastery.\nThis zone also contains deep, water filled tunnels spread around under the map called The Depths. These passageways can be accessed at various points throughout the map by means of large sinkholes. Certain areas of The Depths are shrouded in darkness, containing unavoidable fish that will quickly kill travellers unless they have interacted with an Exalted Beacon.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nFrom Auric Basin: follow the road south-east from  Chak Hollow Waypoint — .\n\n\n== Navigation and orientation ==\nTangled Depths is notorious in-game for being awkward to navigate. Outpost waypoints begin contested and can only become available after completing the local events. Along the southern edge of the map in the center is the Ley-Line Confluence Waypoint - visible on this map of the lower floor. However unlike other zones where undiscovered waypoints show up on the in-game minimap from a good distance away, this undiscovered waypoint will not show up until you are in the Ley-Line Confluence area and you are practically on top of it. From this point four tunnels radiate outwards towards the four camps, clockwise from bottom left; Ogre, Nuhoch, Rata Novus and SCAR. If one can get to the Ley-Line Confluence it is then possible to reach each of the four camps.\nCharacters first arrive in the map at the Order of Whispers Camp, high up to the west. Travel southeast until reaching a deep canyon, jump into it and glide northeast until seeing a waterfall, at which point follow the water further down to the lowest level where the tunnels are. Having followed these directions, one will arrive at the northwest end of the Nuhoch Lane - head southeast to reach the Ley-Line Confluence.\nAdditionally, it is very helpful to gain the Mastery of Nuhoch Wallows (tier 2 of the Nuhoch Lore mastery track) - each of the lower tunnels has a Nuhoch Wallow providing access to the camps, and vice-versa.\nIt is highly recommended to find a Hero Point/Mastery Point train running in this zone which will allow opening of various waypoints in the process of obtaining Hero Points and Mastery Points.  If you ask the leader/commander, they may have the train pass by the Ley-Line Confluence Waypoint.\n\n\n== Map completion ==\n  Barbed Thorn (30)\n  Gift of the Chak\nOne of the following, depending on your profession:\n   Guardian's Cache\n   Revenant's Cache\n   Warrior's Cache\n   Engineer's Cache\n   Ranger's Cache\n   Thief's Cache\n   Elementalist's Cache\n   Mesmer's Cache\n   Necromancer's Cache\nOne of the following:\n  Transmutation Charge\n  Black Lion Chest Key (rare chance)\n  Ley-Line Crystal (50)\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\nTreetop\n\nGround\n\nCaverns\n\nDepths\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Advancing Across Tangled Roots ===\nOutpost: Ogre Camp\n  Join Nokta as he tracks the chak using magic trails (80)\n  Collect chak eggs so the ogres can research them (80)\n  Destroy ley-energy combs to release ley-energy (80)\n  Defeat the enraged chak (80)\n  Protect the ogres as they carry chak eggs to the Mordrem nest (80)\n  Join the ogres in defeating the Mordrem (80)\nOutpost: SCAR Bivouac\n  Help Vincere Shieldstep find the scattered members of his team (80)\n  Help Terrill reinforce the camp with scrap metal barricades and cannons (80)\n  Climb up to the chopper wreckage and toss scrap metal down for Terrill Tinkerclaw (80)\n  Keep the resonators running until they draw in a large target (80)\n [Group Event] Bring down the enraged pair of chak!

Thus, when exploring this zone, it is advisable to first unlock Ley Line Confluence Waypoint. The easiest way to get there from the Order of Whispers Camp Waypoint is to head east and drop down to the Order of Whispers Camp, and from there drop down into the water into Nuhoch Lane. Then, simply head southeast and one should reach Ley Line Confluence Waypoint.\nHaving level 2 Nuhoch mastery which allows the use of Nuhoch Wallows makes traversing this zone significantly easier.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of chests in Tangled Depths",

      "strName": "Verdant Brink",
      "strWikiText": "The Verdant Brink is the first major zone players enter in the Heart of Thorns expansion pack, and is the entrance to the Heart of Maguuma region. The aftermath of the Pact's disastrous assault on Mordremoth is most visible here, with massive vines and still-burning airship wreckage strewn across the landscape. The local Itzel hylek have made fast friends of the newcomers, and will accept Airship Parts for unique and valuable supplies.\nTo secure the area, pockets of Pact survivors and the Itzel tribe can be assisted in their survival against the Mordrem. In the daytime, each outpost needs help in gathering survivors and assembling defenses. During the night, the Mordrem attack in full force, creating a zone-wide battleground to hold rally points and recover supplies. Towards the end of the night, powerful Mordrem lieutenants take residence in the canopy of Verdant Brink, and must be brought down.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nFrom the Silverwastes: the portal to Verdant Brink is in the south-western part of the map, through a door behind Amber Sandfall. First time access is activated through the Story Journal entry Prologue: Rally to Maguuma.\nFrom Auric Basin: the portal to Verdant Brink is in the north-west corner of the map.\nFrom the Lost Precipice guild hall: the portal to Verdant Brink is in the southeastern corner of the map.\n\n\n== Map completion ==\n  Barbed Thorn (30)\n  Gift of the Fleet\nOne of the following, depending on your profession:\n   Guardian's Cache\n   Revenant's Cache\n   Warrior's Cache\n   Engineer's Cache\n   Ranger's Cache\n   Thief's Cache\n   Elementalist's Cache\n   Mesmer's Cache\n   Necromancer's Cache\nOne of the following:\n  Transmutation Charge\n  Black Lion Chest Key (rare chance)\n  Airship Part (50)\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\nSky\n\nGround\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nThe majority of events in Verdant Brink are part of a meta-event. The map meta-events revolve around the Day and night cycle where dusk will count towards the day event and dawn towards the night event. The map meta-event during daytime is Securing Verdant Brink, and the map meta-event during night-time is Night and the Enemy. Progress on building up the five outposts during daytime rolls over when the map transitions to night-time in the form of the number of rally points each outpost controls, up to four per outpost (for a maximum of 20 in total).\n\n\n=== Securing Verdant Brink ===\nDuring the day each of the 5 outposts has its own meta-event chain, which must be completed to fill its bar. After these main chains are completed, small events will occur frequently near the outpost, and a few of the chain's events may repeat.\n\nOutpost: Jaka Itzel\n  Defeat the Mordrem invaders to clear the village (80)\n  Fill the Itzel villagers' food baskets with insect larvae (80)\n  Help Itzel Hunters defeat creatures.

Maintaining control of rally points around an outpost during the three defense waves which occur during the first half of the night is critical for map meta-event progression. Once the Pact Choppers descend halfway through the night (20:30 left on the timer until daybreak), bosses appear in the canopy, one corresponding to each outpost. Along with defense of rally points, killing all the bosses is critical for progressing the map meta-event to tier 4 as these two event types contribute the most to increasing the night-time security level.\nThus, during the first half of the night, making sure rally points are defended during the Mordrem assaults (and retaking any which have been overrun by Mordrem) should be the main priority, followed by escorting soldiers, running supplies and killing rampaging Mordrem. When the bosses appear, slaying them should be a first priority. To achieve these goals, it is important that players spread out evenly across the map in small groups. To reach tier 4 night, about tier 2.5 needs to be achieved from the defense events and all the bosses need to be slain.\nWhen under Pact control, each rally point has a supply level which can be filled by bringing Pact Supplies to the rally point and escorting soldiers. Raising the supply level of a rally point allows it to build extra defenses such as barricades and turrets, making the rally point easier to defend. Each Pact Supply that a player deposits increases the supply level by 1/5 of a tier and each escorted Pact soldier raises it by a full level. Completing any Nighttime event will award the player one stack of  Pact Supplier. This increases experience gained from kills by up to 5%.\n\nRally point defense\nThese are the rally point defense events. There are a total of three defense waves, and they occur during the first half of the night at 44:30, 34:30 and 24:30. Each camp has a primary rally point and 3 secondary rally points.\n [Group Event] Retain control of the rally point (80) (x20)\nFailure:  [Group Event] Recapture the rally point from the Mordrem (80) (x20)\nSupply events\nWreckage of crashed pact choppers periodically appear which produce a large number of Pact Supplies. Pact soldiers appear back to back at set locations to be escorted to rally points. Successfully escorted soldiers upgrade a supply by a fully level; however, if they reach the rally point and it is not under Pact control, the event can quickly fail. Rampaging Mordrem veterans also spawn throughout the jungle floor in patrolling paths, and can get close to rally points or Pact soldiers.\n  Salvage Pact supplies from the wreckage before it collapses (80) (x15)\n  Escort the Pact soldier to the nearest rally point (80) (x15)\n  Kill the rampaging Mordrem (80) (x15)\nCanopy boss fights\nThe night bosses appear in the canopy halfway during the night, at 20:30 on the timer when the Pact choppers arrive.\n [Group Event] Kill Axemaster Gwyllion (80) - Outpost: Noble Crash Site choppers\n [Group Event] Kill Cotoni and Huetzi (80) - Outpost: Jaka Itzel choppers\n [Group Event] Kill the tetrad of Mordrem champions (80) - Outpost: The Ordnance Corps choppers\n [Group Event] Kill the wyvern matriarch (80) - Outpost: Pact Encampment choppers\n [Group Event] Kill the Wyvern Patriarch (80) - Outpost: Pale Reaver Rally choppers\nOther events\n [Group Event] Find and slay the treasure mushroom! (80)\n  Stop the skritt burglar before it escapes with the treasure (80) (x5)\n [Group Event] Kill the Bloodstone-Crazed Wyvern (80)\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n Airship Parts are the zone's currency, awarded for completing events and opening Airship Cargo. These can be used to purchase pieces of Bladed armor, recipes needed to craft Minstrel gear, various collection trophies and more.\n  Pact Crowbars are awarded for each day-time event completed, and for each tier reached during the night-time meta event. These can be used to open Airship Cargo chests that are scattered throughout Verdant Brink. Cargo spawns will be indicated by red pings on the minimap.\nNight-time rewards revolve around getting the map meta event completion to tier 4. This is done through completion of events and killing area bosses. Upon successfully reaching tier 4 night, the map meta event reward will have a chance of awarding a   Bladed Armor Box. The chance increases with higher map participation, with it being a guaranteed award with 100% or above map participation.\nFor research, see here.\n\n\n== Pets ==\nJuvenile Fire Wyvern\nCanopy over Pact Encampment - From Matriarch's Perch, glide to the platform to the south east. Then search to the west.

While searching for a squad of missing Pact scouts in an area north of the jungle, players will confront the Vale Guardian, Gorseval the Multifarious, and Sabetha the Saboteur in three separate encounters.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nThe portal for entering the raid \"Forsaken Thicket (and Spirit Vale) is located in the far northeast corner of Verdant Brink. The in-game map shows an icon for the portal, which can be reached by heading east from the  Jaka Itzel Waypoint —  or north from the  Shipwreck Peak Waypoint — .

The order of the three colored guardians are randomized each run. Each of the divisions is constantly surrounded by Magic Aura, indicated by the very large red aoe circles surrounding them. Players will be dealt pulsing damage every few seconds while standing within the circle, depending on the player's health. It is recommended to fight only one at a time because the pulsing damage from each division stacks (compounding their damage), but it is possible to win against multiple divisions with sufficient coordination. Once a player steps within the aura, the division will start moving towards them.\nA Bullet Storm will also be present while fighting against the Vale Divisions. Light blue balls will spawn around the outer edges and slowly move towards a player. Players that touch one of these balls will be dealt a moderate amount of damage. These balls only travel in a straight line, so can be easily side stepped. Once each division's health has been depleted they will become immune to further damage and their defiance bar will become unlocked, which can only be depleted using crowd control skills. When the bar is broken the division will be defeated.\nEach Vale Guardian Division has at most two special mechanics, as listed in the following section.\n\n\n==== Red Guardian ====\n\nThe Red Guardian has extremely high toughness, rendering damage other than Condition Damage ineffective to the point of dealing single-digit damage.\n\nSpecial Mechanic - Summon Seekers\nThe Red Guardian will summon two red orbs called seekers every 15 seconds. Seekers will last 20 seconds before they disappear. When they spawn, they will slowly gravitate toward a random player and may change targets while en route. All players standing within a seeker's aoe will be dealt high damage continuously.\nSeekers have high health, making it extremely difficult and impractical to attempt to kill them before they disappear. Instead, it is suggested that players make use of knockbacks and pulls to keep them away, as well as effects such as chilled, cripple, or immobilize to impede their advance. Players using knockbacks or pulls should take care to not bring the Seekers towards other players.\n\n\n==== Green Guardian ====\n\nSpecial Mechanic - Unstable Magic Spike (Green Guardian)\nThe Green Guardian periodically creates small blue electric fields under nearby players every 10 seconds. The fields have a distinct sound effect, and will detonate after 2-3 seconds, causing any players standing inside them to be dealt a large amount of damage and teleported to a random location within its Magic Aura. This is dangerous as it can cause players to accidentally initiate combat with other guardians. A yellow border will be present around the player's screen while they are in contact with these fields.\nPlayers are recommended to either move out of the way or dodge before the fields detonate, or alternatively blocked to avoid the damage and teleport.\n\n\n==== Blue Guardian ====\n\nSpecial Mechanic -  Blue Pylon Power\nThe Blue Guardian will start with Blue Pylon Power, which makes it immune to damage. To remove this effect, the invulnerability must be stripped or corrupted. It will regain the Blue Pylon Power effect, as well as protection every 10 seconds.\n\nSpecial Mechanic - Distributed Magic (Blue Guardian)\nThe blue guardian will create a green circle in a random place within its aura every 15 seconds. Visually, a bright green circle shrinks from within the edges of a darker green circle. Once the bright green circle has disappeared, all players within the platform will be dealt a large amount of damage. In order to avoid this damage, a minimum of three players must be standing within the green circle. Doing so will distribute highly reduced damage among the players standing within the circle. Players have approximately 5 seconds to get enough people within the circle, or else suffer a devastating attack. Having less than the required amount of players will result in all nearby players suffering the attack. Do note that players that are downed or in mid-dodge animation will not count as being inside the circle.\n\n\n=== Vale Guardian ===\n\nHealth: 22,021,440\nEnrage Timer: 8 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged - Increases damage dealt by 200%.\nAfter defeating the Vale Divisions and moving forward, players will reach a circular battlefield with the Vale Guardian standing in the center. The battlefield is divided into three sections of equal size, wherein each third of the battlefield has a uniquely colored pylon along the outside edge and a uniquely designed rune tile in the center.\nThe Vale Guardian is an amalgamation of the three previous Vale Divisions. The following changes have been made to their unique mechanics:\n\nSeekers - A Seeker will spawn in the center of each tile around the arena and slowly gravitate towards a player. All Seekers will disappear after 20 seconds and a new set will spawn.\nUnstable Magic Spike (Vale Guardian) (also known as blue circles) - Will deal a large amount of damage and teleport you to a random place around the arena.\nDistributed Magic (Vale Guardian) (also known as green circles) - Requires a minimum of four players inside the green circle or else everyone in the arena will take 80% of their health as damage. These will only spawn in the section the Vale Guardian is standing in.\nPrior to the fight, it is recommended to designate the person who will hold the Vale Guardian's aggro, colloquially called the \"tank\". The Vale Guardian will target the player with the highest toughness out of all players within the arena. If another player gains higher toughness at any point during the fight, it will switch targets.\nThe Distributed Magic (green circle) attack can be dealt with two different ways. The first is to designate four players to go to greens so that the rest of the squad can focus on dealing damage. Players that can do ranged damage are preferred for this team, along with at least one healing profession. It is imperative for this team to be vigilant for when the green circles spawn, as failure to prevent the green circles might wipe your group. Therefore members of this team should stop whatever they are doing and get to these circles as quickly as possible. The second method is to have one or two high caliber healers to mitigate the damage the attack causes. This is only possible if the group stays together and no one gets teleported. Since the attack deals a set percentage of each player's health, healers should ensure everyone is at full health before the green pops, as well as quickly heal them back up afterwards. Additionally, the damage can be partially mitigated by  Barrier.\nA few seconds after a player attacks or gets close enough to the Vale Guardian, an impassable barrier will be erected around the battlefield, making it impossible to leave or to rejoin mid-fight. Players standing outside of the arena will be immediately killed.\n\nPhase 1\nOnce the fight has begun, the \"tank\" should try to keep the Vale Guardian in one place. The Vale Guardian's main attack is a punch, which cleaves; therefore, the tank should be the only one in front, and the rest should be in the back to avoid unnecessary damage.\nThere are a few common strategies for tanking Vale Guardian:\n\nTile Center: This strategy is commonly chosen if the squad chooses to have 4 players stand in every green. The tank tanks near the center of an edge of a tile, such as near a Speed Boost Mushroom, for the players that have trained the Blazing Speed Mushrooms mastery (note that the buffs given by the Speed Boost Mushroom do not stack with  Swiftness or  Quickness). This minimizes the distance that the party has to travel to any potential green spawn. It also ensures the party is as far away as possible from two of the seekers.\nLine: This strategy is commonly chosen if the squad chooses to outheal the green. The tank stands on the edge of the circle on a line between two tiles. This maximizes distance away from the seekers, so the squad has to deal with them as little as possible.\nCenter: This strategy is extremely risky and is only recommended if the squad can outheal the green and effectively deal with moving out and/or immobilizing the seekers. The tank will keep Vale Guardian standing in the center of the arena. Since this places the squad right in the center of the three seekers that spawn, players will have to actively manage keeping seekers away to avoid taking extremely heavy damage from them. Due to the speed at which seekers come back in, it is recommended that the squad have very high squad dps in order to effectively carry out this strategy, as squads with lower dps may have their seeker management skills on cooldown if the seekers come back in too many times. This strategy is commonly done to maximize dps and minimize kill time - since Vale Guardian is stationary in the middle the entire time, players do not have to either wait for or follow Vale Guardian as it walks out towards the tank.\nThroughout the fight, the Vale Guardian will continuously summon Seekers, use Unstable Magic Spike (Vale Guardian) (small blue circles), and spawn Distributed Magic (Vale Guardian) (green circles). Depending on your team composition, there are multiple ways of dealing with these situations.\n\nIt is possible for unfavorable scenarios to happen because of this, such as a Seeker spawning on top of a green circle, or blue circles on top of a green circle, or failing to avoid the Unstable Magic Spike and getting teleported on top of a Seeker, etc.\nSome common utilities for moving around seekers include a Chronomancer's Temporal Curtain (focus 4) and a Druid's Glyph of the Tides. Players can also immobilize them in place, such as with a Druid's Entangle and Natural Convergence.\nIn addition to moving out or dodging the blue circles, players can also block them to avoid the teleport. Note that each field handles its teleport separately, therefore if a player is standing on two fields at the same time, they might block the first field but still get teleported by the second field.\nThe 80% flat damage taken from green circles places very high pressure on the healers if the squad chooses to not do greens. However, because it is based off a percentage of the health bar, damage from the greens can also be mitigated with  Barrier. With some barrier, this alleviates some pressure on the healers, as healers do not have to keep every player perfectly topped off on health before the greens pop. Furthermore, players will generally have a lot more health after the green pops, which allows for more room of error afterwards too, such as seekers or blue circles deal damage as well.\nPhase 2\nAt 66% health, the Vale guardian will turn Invulnerable and start walking towards the center of the arena. During this time 2-3 players with Condition damage should go to the red pillar, one person to the green pillar, and the rest to the blue pillar. Shortly after, the Vale Guardian will disappear and spawn the three Vale Divisions at their respective pillar. Players will also gain Pylon Attunement: Red, Pylon Attunement: Green, or Pylon Attunement: Blue depending on which section they were standing in before the divisions spawn. All divisions will have their Magic Aura. Standing within the aura of the division that is not the same color as your attunement will result in heavy pulsing damage. Each Division functions similarly to how it was done prior to the Vale Guardian fight, but with significantly less health. The group should be able to defeat the Blue Guardian while the Green Guardian is being pulled over to the group. The Condition damage players should be able to defeat the Red Guardian at this point as well. Groups with higher dps may choose to split into three groups to defeat each of the guardians at once.\nTheir mechanics change slightly during this phase and will return to normal afterwards.\n\nSeekers (Red Guardian) - A Seeker will spawn at the rune in the center of that section. This Seeker can target any player within the arena, not just the ones nearby. A new one will spawn every 15 seconds and last 20 seconds before disappearing.\nUnstable Magic Spike (Green Guardian) - The blue circles will only spawn for the players nearby, however they will teleport players within them anywhere around the arena. Players should take care because they can be teleported to the other guardians.\nDistributed Magic (Blue Guardian) - Drops down to three players within this phase. Will deal a 80% to each player in the arena if there are not enough people.\nPhase 3\nOnce all 3 Vale Divisions are defeated, the Vale Guardian reappears in the center of the arena. During this phase, the green pylon's section will be affected by Unstable Pylon, indicated by the lit up floor, which deals 2000 damage every second to players standing within. This damage is unaffected by damage reduction like protection. Every 20 seconds, the section that is lit by Unstable Pylon will rotate clockwise. This means that it is unfeasible to stand in one place, unlike the first phase. The \"tank\" must continuously move the Vale Guardian during this phase to avoid having the green circle spawn in the lit up section. While it is possible to successfully clear the green circle if this happens, it is extremely difficult to come out of it unscathed. Players should also try to avoid the blue circles during this phase, as it is possible to get teleported into the lit up section.\nThere are 3 methods to deal with the floor:\n\nAround-the-world method — Starting at the border of the red and green sections, the \"tank\" should try their best to stay to the left of the lit floor, and move to the next once when it becomes safe. Due to the timing of floor changing and the spawn time of the green circles, it is possible to have two or more green circles spawn in a section before moving to the next one. Moving onto a lit section early is more preferred than getting there too late. This mindset becomes much more important in the final phase. This option is safer due to always being two sections ahead of the floor but slower because you need to keep moving.\nLine method — Starting at the border between any two sections, the \"tank\" keeps the Vale Guardian to the right of the border until just before the floor changes onto their current section. Before it happens the \"tank\" moves over the line to the now safe section before moving back after it has passed. Like the above method, moving onto the lit section early is preferable to late, however moving too early may cause the green circles to spawn in the lit section so timing is important. If it happens to spawn in the wrong section, players should not attempt to go for it and the healers should make sure everyone is above 80% health and brace for the incoming damage. This option is faster due to the Vale Guardian being stationary for longer but more dangerous due to the timing required and possible distance to reach the green circles.\nCenter method — For this method, the \"tank\" keeps the Vale Guardian in the center, only needing to move to the safe section so the Vale Guardian doesn't attack anyone else. This method is the fastest but also most dangerous due to the green circles being able to spawn in any section. It is also possible for all three seekers to converge on your location.\nThe Vale Guardian will gain a new attack during this phase - Magic Storm. The Vale Guardian will stop moving and throw its fist in the air, flinging out balls of energy randomly around the arena. Its defiance bar will also unlock at this time. Players should try to break the bar as quickly as possible, because taking too long may cause the green circle to spawn in the lit up section. The Vale Guardian will automatically stop this attack after 20 seconds or if the lit up section changes (whichever happens first). However, if this happens the green circle will certainly spawn in the lit up section. A green circle cannot spawn while his defiance bar is up.\n\nPhase 4\nThe fourth phase starts when the Vale Guardian reaches 33% and is exactly the same as the second phase.\n\nPhase 5\nOnce all 3 Vale Divisions are defeated for the last time, the Vale Guardian reappears in the center of the arena. In general, this final phase is very similar to the third phase. The most notable difference is that an additional section of the arena will be affected by Unstable Pylon. Initially, the red pylon's section will be safe. The lit up sections will also rotate every 17 seconds (down from 20).\nDue to this timing change, having two or more green circles spawn in a section becomes a lot more dangerous. The \"tank\" should attempt to move the Vale Guardian to the next section (regardless of whether it's lit or not) as soon as the green circle gets cleared. The Magic Storm attack also becomes a lot more dangerous because the Vale Guardian will not move. Taking too long to break its defiance bar will certainly cause a green circle to spawn in the (now) newly lit up section.\nThe following changes will happen to the special mechanics:\n\nSeekers - An additional Seeker will spawn in the center of the arena, along with one at each of the runes in the center of each section. There will be a total of 4 Seekers up at any time.\nUnstable Magic Spike (also known as blue circles) - Will target all players regardless of proximity. Players that are part of the green circle team should try to avoid standing on it until they are certain that this will not spawn under them.\nDistributed Magic (also known as green circles) - No change, but the above two changes will make it slightly harder to deal with. Having a back up will help.\n\n\n=== Spirit Woods ===\n\nPart 1 - Spectral Rifts\nAfter defeating the Vale Guardian, players get access to the encounter Spirit Woods and need to complete tasks to open gates and progress. To open the first gate, players must first kill all the spirits in the area to trigger the event.\nAfter all the spirits are defeated Spectral Rifts will begin to spawn in addition to more spirits. Players have to stand inside of the Spectral Rifts for a period of time to close them and prevent them from dealing massive damage to all players, often wiping the run. The more players present in a given rift the faster its progress bar will move. Progress bars for each rift, as well as the overall progress on the encounter, can be seen in the upper right hand portion of the screen. The rifts spawn randomly in fixed locations. Two at east (near the River of Souls), one at north (near the gate), another at south (near the stairs) and another at west. Orange AoE attacks will spawn throughout the area and can knock players down. Faster movement skills, stability, and stun breaks are very useful to avoid this. Portal skills are very valuable here to cross large distances. There are also Adrenal Mushrooms that can be used to lower skill cooldowns if the mastery has been completed.\nAfter opening the first gate, players enter the Abandoned Outpost. Killing all the spirits here opens the second gate. The brazier can be picked up and carried throughout the encounter to complete the Keep the Lights On achievement, and for access to the third hidden chest. Note, if the player holding the torch gets downed or killed or weapon swaps during the rest of the encounter the torch is lost.\n\nPart 2 - Spirit Race\nThis part needs to be done as fast as possible. After landing from the ledge of the second gate, a massive wall of ghosts will start chasing the players. Players must close the Spectral Rifts while destroying the Ethereal Barriers. The first and second parts have 1 rift, the third part has 2 rifts and the fourth part has 3 rifts. Often 2-4 support players will stand in these to ensure all rifts get closed and the barriers destroyed.\n\nPart 3 - Cemetery\nAt Bandit's Rest, 5 players need to stand on top of 5 ground pads to open the final gate. The first is past the staircase to the left in a small alcove. The rest of the group typically then attempt the jumping puzzle across the branch and mushrooms to reach the highest pad next to the gate. Once one person is successful there is a small building below that pad that contains the third one. The fourth is reached by going up the stairs to the left, the same ones used to reach the jumping puzzle, and continuing past the tree branch jump down to the lower ledge. The final pad is also to the right side of the area behind some buildings after going up the much smaller staircase. Once each of these pads has a person standing on it all at the same time the gate will open and the encounter will be completed. Note, a downed or defeated player cannot activate a button.\n\n\n=== Gorseval the Multifarious ===\nHealth: 21,628,200\nEnrage Timer: 7 minutes\nEnrage Effect: Removes all updrafts and gains  Enraged, Increases damage dealt by 200%.\nPhase 1\nTo start the fight, players must glide onto the platform. Gorseval won't attack until the first person gets near it, so it is recommended to glide to the edge of the platform. Once the fight starts, Spirit Barriers will be erected around the platform and four updrafts will spawn in each corner.\nGorseval has two main attacks he will use throughout the fight: a swipe, which deals a small amount of damage to players in front; and a slam, which deals a moderate amount of damage and  knocks back all nearby players. When you see it raise his arm high in the air, it is recommended to either block it with  Aegis or  Stability, or dodge it.\nEvery once in a while he will teleport to the center of the platform and start channeling his Ghostly Rampage attack. During this time, Gorseval will gain a defiance bar and  Vivid Echo, which functions similarly to retaliation. While channeling this skill, parts of the arena will be filled with black goop in a set pattern which detonates after a few seconds. Players standing within the goop when it detonates will be dealt a large amount of damage and receive 25 stacks of  Vulnerability. At the end of the channel, the entire platform will be covered in the black goop. Breaking the defiance bar will knockdown Gorseval and interrupt the attack; any black goop remaining after this attack was interrupted will still detonate. After this attack finishes, Gorseval will summon four Angered and/or an Enraged Spirit.\nA short while after Ghostly Rampage ends, Gorseval channels the World Eater attack. A red circle will start expanding from the center of the platform, and once it completely fills the platform, all players and spirits still standing on the platform are instantly killed. In order to avoid this attack, players will need to reach the next phase by bringing Gorseval's health down to 66%, or destroy a spirit barrier and glide into an updraft before returning to the platform. Gorseval will gain one stack of  Spirited Fusion for each spirit killed by this attack, therefore it is recommended to kill all spirits before gliding off. Shortly after returning, Gorseval will channel his Ghostly Rampage attack again.\n\nSpirit Phase\nWhen Gorseval reaches 66% HP he will gain  Protective Shadow, making him invulnerable, and move to the center. Four Charged Souls will spawn, each in a different part of the platform (northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest) and begin walking towards Gorseval. If a spirit reaches Gorseval, he will immediately begin his World Eater attack. The spirits are immune to hard crowd control effects such as knockback or daze, but are susceptible to soft crowd control.  Immobile,  Chilled and  Crippled work very well for slowing the spirit's progress towards Gorseval. Once all four spirits have been killed, Gorseval becomes vulnerable once again and the fight moves to the next phase.\n\nPhase 2\nThis phase is the same as Phase 1 with one additional mechanic:  Spectral Darkness (also known as orbs), which spawn periodically. They will emanate a circle that slowly increases in size. Any player that touches this circle will receive 10 stacks of  Spectral Darkness, which reduces their outgoing damage by 10% per stack, and increases incoming damage by 10% per stack. To remove the effect, players must walk over golden orbs which spawn after an orb is destroyed. Each orb will drop two when it is destroyed, and each golden orb that you pick up will remove five stacks of Spectral Darkness.\nKeeping the orbs under control in this phase is very important. Players should focus on destroying the ones that have spawned close to the center, by the Charged Souls or towards an updraft. Once Gorseval reaches 33% health there will be another Spirit Phase. It will largely be the same as last time, but with orbs spawning throughout.\n\nPhase 3\nIn addition to the orbs, Gorseval gains another attack:  Ghastly Prison. After using his slam, small circles will appear under every player's feet. After a second, players standing within these circles will be encased in a cocoon. Players trapped in a Ghastly Prison will lose access to all of their skills and must break out of the prison using the skill   Rebel (default: 1). Players that are not trapped within a Ghastly Prison may help break them out by dealing damage to it. The pattern of Gorseval's Ghostly Rampage attack also changes during this phase. The fight continues in this way until Gorseval is defeated.\n\n\n=== Bandits ===\nAfter finishing the second boss of the raid, players will need to glide down to a nearby bandit camp. While passing through it, players will occasionally get tagged with Sapper Bombs (indicated by green circles under the players' feet). Players receiving the Sapper Bomb will also see the option to throw the bomb via their Special action key (default: -). Sapper bombs thrown on the launch pad will launch all players standing on said launch pad at the moment of impact. Players without the Explosive Launch mastery will be dealt a moderate amount of damage.\nThis event is good to learn how to throw Sapper Bombs and use launch pads. Killing all the Bandits here opens the Sabetha fight.\n\n\n=== Sabetha the Saboteur ===\nHealth: 34,015,256\nEnrage Timer: 9 minutes\nEnrage Effect: All four cannons become active and gains  Enraged, increasing outgoing damage by 500%\nIn addition to the enrage timer encountered in the Vale Guardian and Gorseval the Multifarious fights, the Sabetha encounter also has a bar showing the platform health. If the platform is completely destroyed during the fight, players will fall to their deaths resulting in a failure. Besides her shotgun attack, which deals a small amount of damage to all players in front of her, bandits will spawn throughout the fight. They have special attacks such as a kick that knocks players back and a flamethrower attack that deals damage very quickly.\nThere are four special mechanics that will repeat throughout the fight: a flak attack, a timed bomb, a flamewall and cannons.\n\nFlak Shot\nThe flak attack will always target the furthest player from herself. As such it is important to have one dedicated 'flak kiter' - a player who will move around the edges of the arena in order to keep the deadly flak off the rest of the team. Sabetha will alternate between both flak and shotgun consistently throughout the fight, using one attack, and then the other until another mechanic happens.\n\nTime bomb\nAt the start of each Sabetha phase and every 15 seconds (except during a Flamewall),  Time Bomb will always be placed on the player closest to Sabetha. The selected player will have a large circle around them, with an inner circle that will slowly expand until the entire circle is filled. Once filled, the player it was placed on will take a small amount of damage. All other players within the circle will be dealt a large amount of damage. This damage cannot be dodged or evaded, but it can be blocked. Players with the time bomb should run away from the group until it has gone off before returning to the group.\n\nFlamewall\nEvery 45 seconds Sabetha will draw an arrow in the direction of a random player and spawn a flamewall. This flamewall will rotate 360 degrees counter-clockwise around the platform in slow motion. All players that touch the wall will be immediately defeated. The flamewall cannot be evaded or blocked; a very lucky evade frame might keep players alive, but this is not to be relied upon. Players can, however, use invulnerability through the flamewall if timed correctly as well. If Bandit Thugs are up, players should take care to not get kicked into the path of the flamewall. Additionally, if Sabetha hasn't returned during her 45 seconds flamewall cooldown, it will always be her first mechanic when she returns, and it will always roughly be aimed in the direction of the entrance bridge instead of a random player.\nThe flamewall can be outrun if you are close enough to Sabetha, but you can minimize your movement if you stand to the left of the arrow, then move back to the right once the wall is far enough away. Although the flamewall may not seem to move fast for players near Sabetha, due to angular velocity players near the outer edge will see the wall move very quickly relative to the center, making it extremely difficult to outrun. Any players on the outer edge are therefore advised to move in as close as possible in order to avoid the attack.\n\nCannons and Sapper bombs\nThroughout the fight cannons will spawn every 30 seconds in a fixed pattern, which alternate after the previous one has finished:\n\nSouth → West → North → East\nFollowed by:\n\nSouth → North → West → East\nThe cannon will fire down at the platform dealing damage to it and making it dangerous to stand in that quadrant of the arena. The more cannons that are up, the more damage the platform will take.\nA Bandit Sapper will spawn periodically on the side of the platform opposite of the next cannon. They will mark the west-most player within their range and give them a special action skill   Sapper Bomb, which are used to launch players up to the cannons. Players that have the the sapper bomb are marked by a green circle under them. The sapper bomb will time out after a few seconds. Sapper bombs must be thrown on the jump pads located at the four corners of the platform. All players standing on the launch pads at the time will be sent up to the platform where a cannon spawns.\nPlayers that have been launched will the afflicted with  Shell-Shocked, rendering them unable to be launched by another sapper bomb for 50 seconds. This means a minimum of 2 players are required in order to deal with the cannons as they come up. Less experienced groups can use four players, one for each direction. Players on cannon duty are recommended (but not required) to use teleport and other movement skills to reach the launch pads more quickly. Players without the Explosive Launch mastery will take damage when launched by the sapper bomb.\nOnce on the platform with the cannon, the player should fully destroy the cannon before gliding back to the main platform. There will be a Bandit Sniper on an unreachable platform that will constantly fire at them. Being hit by the sniper will apply  Target!, causing them to take increased damage from subsequent attacks. Taking too long to destroy the cannon will cause them to go downed to the sniper, either while on the platform or while gliding back. The sniper can be killed, but it is not worth the trouble. Players should watch for the flamewall while gliding back. There is a small updraft that players can use to wait until the flamewall passes, but it can only be used once.\nWhen the fight begins players should immediately make their way to Sabetha and position themselves in front of the south launch pad and prepare to launch the first player up to the cannons when it spawns. The first flamewall will coincide with the first cannon spawn, so it is best to wait until the flamewall passes over the launch pad before sending the player up. If the player was not able to be sent up (by either missing the launch pad or the bomb timing out) then players should wait for the sapper to give players the next bomb. If the sapper was killed before this could happen then the cannon should be skipped. After sending them up, the group should move to position themselves for the next cannon spawn. Groups will frequently stack on the side of Sabetha where the next cannon will spawn, so as to minimize movement for the cannon-goer if a flamewall spawns on group. If possible, players should pull the remaining bandits nearby and kill them to prevent being overrun.\n\nBandit Champions\nAt 75%, 50% and 25%, Sabetha will shadowstep off the platform and one of her champions will take her place. Each champion has their own unique attack that needs to be avoided. While Sabetha is away, players will not need to worry about flak, timed bombs or her flamewall. Cannons must be continued to be dealt with. While on the cannon platforms, Sabetha may be there too, however she will be invulnerable and ignore the player. Once her champion has reached 25% health or a minute has passed, Sabetha will return to the platform and immediately use her flamewall. Her champion should be prioritized before turning your attention back to her.\n\nHeavy Bombs\nWhile fighting her champions, Sabetha will toss Heavy Bombs onto the platform. These bombs will spawn randomly on the platform and have a timer above them which will slowly fill up. Once filled, they will explode and deal a large amount of damage to the platform. They will also knock nearby players back. Players can kick the bombs away using their interact key (default: F).\n\nKernan\nHealth: 3,440,850\nAt 75% health, Sabetha will shadowstep off the platform and her first champion, Kernan, will take her place. Unlike Sabetha, Kernan can chase players around the platform. Kernan's main attack is to shoot a player for a small amount of damage. Every few seconds she will fire three consecutive cone attacks in one direction. Each one will cover a larger area than the last and deal more damage. The third shot of this attack will deal the most damage. Because this attack only goes in one direction, players can step to the side or go behind her to avoid the attack. Alternatively, they can be evaded or blocked.\n\n\"Knuckles\"\nHealth: 3,440,850\nAt 50% health, Sabetha will leave and summon \"Knuckles\". His main attack is to swing his hammer at players; dealing a small amount of damage. Every 30 seconds, \"Knuckles\" will charge up a hammer swing with the hammer over his shoulder and unlock his Defiance bar. Fail to break this bar and \"Knuckles\" will knock all players up and push them outwards. It is possible to be knocked off the platform by this attack. If players find themselves getting hit by this attack, they should immediately try to deploy their glider while in the air to avoid the knockback.\nAfter Sabetha has returned, she will start using  Time Bomb on the two nearest players instead of one. These two players should try not to go in the same direction, lest they blow up each other. There is a short delay until the second player gets their bomb.\n\nKarde\nHealth: 4,423,950\nAt 25% health, Sabetha will withdraw once more leaving Karde in her place. Karde possess two abilities which are of great concern to the player group. First is Karde's flamethrower attack, which inflicts damage extremely quickly to all players in front of him. Additionally, Karde will periodically summon flame turrets which shoot out projectiles. If these are not dealt with quickly, they will grow in number and quickly become unmanageable.\nAfter Sabetha returns, she will begin to use Platform Crush, an ability which causes debris to fall from the sky, marked by small circles on the ground. Being hit deals a small amount of damage. Once Karde has been defeated, it is a race between whether Sabetha is defeated or the platform gets destroyed.\n\nEnrage\nIf her enrage timer runs out she will become Enraged and all four cannons will spawn.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nScholar Glenna\nCharr\nVeteran Vigil Medic\nWhispers Agent\nInsect\nBeetle\nNorn\nSquad Leader Falgeir\nSylvari\nPriory Explorer\nVarious\nPact Prisoner\nVigil Crusader\nVigil Recruit\nVigil Warmaster\nWhispers Slayer\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nBandits\nBandit Arsonist\nBandit Sapper\nBandit Sniper\nBandit Thug\nKarde\nKernan\n\"Knuckles\"\nSabetha the Saboteur (boss)\nGhosts\nAngered Spirit\nChampion Angered Spirit\nDeranged Spirit\nChampion Deranged Spirit\nEnraged Spirit\nChampion Enraged Spirit\nGorseval the Multifarious (boss)\nElementals\nBlue Guardian\nGreen Guardian\nRed Guardian\nVale Guardian (boss)\nSaurians\nPocket Raptor\nUnknown\nEast Cannon\nNorth Cannon\nSouth Cannon\nWest Cannon\n\n\n== Objects ==\nAnvil\nCooking Station\nDead bandit\nFallen Pact Soldier\nGravestone\nJournal Entry\nLey Rift\nMap\nPact Scout\nPaper\nTent\nWooden Plank\nChests\nGuardian Chest\nGorseval's Chest\nHidden chest\nSabetha's Chest\nMushrooms\nAdrenal Mushroom\nBouncing Mushroom\nSpeed Boost Mushroom\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\nUpon entering and passing the pact camp, one of the following\n\n<Squad member>: Let's get to work.\n<Squad member>: All right. Let's find these soldiers.\nApproaching Squad Leader Falgeir\n\nSquad Leader Falgeir has multiple possible ambient dialogues at this point.\nOne of these lines:\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Bandits attacked our platoon, inflicted heavy casualties on us. They captured one of our squads and went that way.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Our platoon was ambushed. The enemy captured an entire squad and took them deep into the woods.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: They took our squad hostage and brought them deeper into the woods. We have to find them.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Those troops will die if we don't get to them in time. Bandits took them deep into the woods.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: We never saw them coming. They killed some of our soldiers and took the rest hostage. We need to find them.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Before you ask, no, I'm not the missing recon squad leader. Nothing's ever easy, right?\nFollowed by one of these lines:\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Be careful. Sabetha won't think twice about burning you alive if you make it into the woods.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Find our squad. Sabetha will kill them if you don't reach them in time.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Sabetha took the squad straight ahead. Her sentries are blocking the way. Get ready for a serious fight.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Stay alert out there.

Similar to the cat in Scholar's Cleft, it is not an NPC, as it has no overhead name and cannot be clicked on, is a unique model and is mostly likely the cat of one of the game's designers. However unlike the Scholar's Cleft cat, this cat only shakes its head and makes no other movement.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Spirit Vale\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial release page",

Need anything?\nGuild Initiative Representative: We need to clear this tunnel to get to the good stuff further down.\nGuild Initiative Representative: Which do you prefer?

I'm the, err, provisioner sent from the Guild Initiative. Meaning, I make the chow.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Those shortsighted desk jockeys suggested a mess hall, but what we need is a proper tavern.

I've got no time for eating! There's stuff in the ground, and we need it!\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: You're very passionate about your work. What are you looking to mine, anyway?\nRekka: Raw aetherium! Initiative surveyors discovered an unusual concentration of it here. We might even hit a mother lode!\nRekka: That aetherium could provide a tremendous source of magic—once we dig it up. Now can you see why I'm so excited?\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: I can! Still, you can't mine on an empty stomach. Sit and eat. An official will come to discuss the mine soon enough.\nAfter Tavern Restoration 2\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: This new tavern is a sight to see!

I am hungry, come to think of it.\nCastor Shoutsman: Ah, yes! Food fight!\nSophia Carriker: (sigh) Kormir, grant me patience.\nAfter Workshop Restoration 2\nKensho Arrowsoul: My people say that teaching is also a lesson. It is true. In helping the guild, I have learned much.\nKensho Arrowsoul: The study of pen and ink is as old as the tengu. My people consider it a sacred and beloved art.\nKensho Arrowsoul: I hope that you will understand that I do not undertake this task lightly.\nKensho Arrowsoul: Sharing knowledge is difficult for the tengu. We have been betrayed by others in our past.\nKensho Arrowsoul: I trust you. I trust this guild.

You judge too much with your eyes alone.\nKensho Arrowsoul: My purpose is to find purpose. Can you say the same?\nKensho Arrowsoul: If you wait by the river long enough, you will see the body of your enemy float by.\nKensho Arrowsoul: A grand day for an adventure.\nKensho Arrowsoul: The clock's ticking, and Tyria is at risk, hurry along now.\nKensho Arrowsoul: The sky above is bright and clear. I am grateful for every wind that rises.\nAfter obtaining Market Restoration 1\nBrine Clutchall: Wise move, starting reconstruction of the market. We'll need that to start up commerce.\nBrine Clutchall: I want to make sure everything's perfect, so I'll go survey the build site.\nBrine Clutchall: Well, it's a temporary setup, but it will suffice.\nBrine Clutchall: We need more permanency if we want our customers to start forming habits.\nBrine Clutchall: And by that I mean, if we want people to keep buying our goods!\nAfter obtaining Market Restoration 2\nBrine Clutchall: Finished at last!\nBrine Clutchall: Money for me, merchandise for the guild...\nBrine Clutchall: Then a little money for me, a little more merchandise for the guild...\nBrine Clutchall: And then, when I retire, I buy a sweet little vacation house in Garenhoff.

Uh, literally and figuratively speaking.\nRekka: Let's go see what the dig site looks like!\nRekka: Hmm. Not bad, not bad at all! Solid geology. Plenty of room for expansion.\nRekka: I just know we're going to find tons of raw aetherium here. You'll see!\nRekka: And in that vein...heh...I do have some thoughts about increasing efficiency.\nRekka: For example, do the miners really need three entirely separate meal breaks? Why not eat everything at once?\n(After Kensho arrives at the central hollow waypoint)\nKensho Arrowsoul: Greetings. I have come to share my wisdom with your guild.\n(After Kensho walks over to the tavern)\nKensho Arrowsoul: Greetings, tavernmaster. May the winds lift you to glory.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Winds...? Uh, well, thank you. May the winds lift you...a beer.\nKensho Arrowsoul: Beer, you say? Ah, yes. I would like some of this beverage. Thank you for your offer.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Before you drink anything, I should ask you-have you had beer before?\nKensho Arrowsoul: Only once, when celebrating the death of Zhaitan with some norn in our trading post. It is...quite pleasant, this beer.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: We're going to get along just fine.\nAfter Mine Excavation 2\nRekka: Excellent. Expanding the mine will allow us to increase production!\nRekka: We're definitely going to need more aetherium storage tanks.\nAfter Mine Excavation 3\nRekka: I'm very pleased. This place is finally starting to look like a functional mine.\nRekka: Since we have the space, I'm thinking we should move the miners' beds in here. Get rid of that wasted travel time!\nAfter War Room Restoration 2\nSophia Carriker: Finally finished! It's a weight off my mind to see this place complete.\nSophia Carriker: New tactics, guild badges, soldiers, crafting... This will give the guild a fighting chance!\nSophia Carriker: I wish I could go out and fight, but those days are over for me.\nSophia Carriker: I'm content to stay in the war room and help where I can.\nSophia Carriker: Anytime you need me, I'll be here.\n\n\n== Crafting resources ==\nResource nodes\n Ore Synthesizer (Only with Ore Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Lumber Synthesizer (Only with Lumber Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Berry Synthesizer (Only with Plant Synthesizers 1 or better)\n Cloth Synthesizer (Only with Cloth Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Herb Synthesizer (Only with Plant Synthesizers 1 or better)\n Leather Synthesizer (Only with Leather Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Vegetable Synthesizer (Only with Plant Synthesizers 1 or better)\nFishing nodes\n Freshwater Fish\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nGetting there\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nTenebrous weapons require access to this guild hall to unlock.\nPlayers without the Heart of Thorns expansion cannot use the portal to Auric Basin.",

Need anything?\nGuild Initiative Representative: We need to clear this tunnel to get to the good stuff further down.\nGuild Initiative Representative: Which do you prefer? A pick or a shovel?\nGuild Initiative Representative: Nothing wrong with a little honest work.\nAfter claiming your guild hall, but before Tavern Restoration 1\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Hello there, friend! I'm the, err, provisioner sent from the Guild Initiative. Meaning, I make the chow.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Those shortsighted desk jockeys suggested a mess hall, but what we need is a proper tavern. Right?\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: I'll get something temporary set up while we plan a permanent establishment. Something classy. With beer.\nAfter Tavern Restoration 1\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Great! I'm glad you agreed to \"tavern\" over \"mess hall.\" You're clearly a smart bunch.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Let's see what we can get set up for you!\n(After Gamli runs over to the tavern)\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Very nice! Now we've got a proper place to have a pint!\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: This spot will be comfy for entertaining newcomers, workers, visitors, and guild members.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Running a tavern takes a lot of work! I need to order supplies, stock the shelves, create a menu...\n(After Rekka spawns at the central hollow waypoint but before she runs over to the tavern)\nRekka: Congratulations, I've arrived. No celebrations, please. I just want to start mining.\n(After Rekka runs over to the tavern)\nRekka: Hey there! Barkeep! Whose ear do I bend about getting mining operations started around here?\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Mining? But you just got here! Pull up a chair, have a bit to eat.\nRekka: Eating? I've got no time for eating! There's stuff in the ground, and we need it!\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: You're very passionate about your work. What are you looking to mine, anyway?\nRekka: Raw aetherium! Initiative surveyors discovered an unusual concentration of it here. We might even hit a mother lode!\nRekka: That aetherium could provide a tremendous source of magic—once we dig it up. Now can you see why I'm so excited?\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: I can! Still, you can't mine on an empty stomach. Sit and eat. An official will come to discuss the mine soon enough.\nAfter Tavern Restoration 2\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: This new tavern is a sight to see! I'll admit, I wasn't sure we'd get it repaired properly.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: But look at it now! Why, anyone would be proud to have a drink and share a story here.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: You've done well getting this place put together.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: You think it's nice now, wait 'til I start serving my famous rabbit stew!\nAfter Workshop Restoration 1\nKensho Arrowsoul: I am pleased that you recognize the value in establishing a scribal workshop.\nKensho Arrowsoul: I will oversee a temporary space to begin our work. Hopefully soon the guild can create a more permanent studio.\nKensho Arrowsoul: This will be an adequate beginning. We have pen, and ink, and shelter.\nKensho Arrowsoul: Let us embark upon the ever-challenging study of magical scripts.\n(After Castor Shoutsman, Brine Clutchall, and Sophia Carriker arrive at the central hollow waypoint)\nCaster Shoutsman: This place is epic, epic, epic!\nBrine Clutchall: You can say that again!\nSophia Carriker: But please don't.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Welcome to our tavern strangers! Are you the three Initiative specialists I heard would be joining us?\nCastor Shoutsman: Congratulations, you are correct!\nBrine Clutchall: He's always like that. You get used to it.\nSophia Carriker: Or you'll invest in earplugs.\nBrine Clutchall: Brine Clutchall. I'm here to set up a market. A pleasure to meet you, barkeep.\nSophia Carriker: I'm Sophia Carriker, retired captain. Here to establish a war room for the guild.\nCastor Shoutsman: Castor Shoutsman!

I am hungry, come to think of it.\nCastor Shoutsman: Ah, yes! Food fight!\nSophia Carriker: (sigh) Kormir, grant me patience.\nAfter Workshop Restoration 2\nKensho Arrowsoul: My people say that teaching is also a lesson. It is true. In helping the guild, I have learned much.\nKensho Arrowsoul: The study of pen and ink is as old as the tengu. My people consider it a sacred and beloved art.\nKensho Arrowsoul: I hope that you will understand that I do not undertake this task lightly.\nKensho Arrowsoul: Sharing knowledge is difficult for the tengu. We have been betrayed by others in our past.\nKensho Arrowsoul: I trust you. I trust this guild. It is my honor to educate and serve those whom I respect.\nKensho Arrowsoul: Ah, you think I am so different? You judge too much with your eyes alone.\nKensho Arrowsoul: My purpose is to find purpose. Can you say the same?\nKensho Arrowsoul: If you wait by the river long enough, you will see the body of your enemy float by.\nKensho Arrowsoul: A grand day for an adventure.\nKensho Arrowsoul: The clock's ticking, and Tyria is at risk, hurry along now.\nKensho Arrowsoul: The sky above is bright and clear. I am grateful for every wind that rises.\nAfter obtaining Market Restoration 1\nBrine Clutchall: Wise move, starting reconstruction of the market. We'll need that to start up commerce.\nBrine Clutchall: I want to make sure everything's perfect, so I'll go survey the build site.\nBrine Clutchall: Well, it's a temporary setup, but it will suffice.\nBrine Clutchall: We need more permanency if we want our customers to start forming habits.\nBrine Clutchall: And by that I mean, if we want people to keep buying our goods!\nAfter obtaining Market Restoration 2\nBrine Clutchall: Finished at last!\nBrine Clutchall: Money for me, merchandise for the guild...\nBrine Clutchall: Then a little money for me, a little more merchandise for the guild...\nBrine Clutchall: And then, when I retire, I buy a sweet little vacation house in Garenhoff. Right by the lake!\nBrine Clutchall: We're going to have a beautiful future, my friend. A beautiful future.\nAfter Mine Excavation 1\nRekka: Finally! We're breaking ground on the mine! Uh, literally and figuratively speaking.\nRekka: Let's go see what the dig site looks like!\nRekka: Hmm. Not bad, not bad at all! Solid geology. Plenty of room for expansion.\nRekka: I just know we're going to find tons of raw aetherium here. You'll see!\nRekka: And in that vein...heh...I do have some thoughts about increasing efficiency.\nRekka: For example, do the miners really need three entirely separate meal breaks? Why not eat everything at once?\n(After Kensho arrives at the central hollow waypoint)\nKensho Arrowsoul: Greetings. I have come to share my wisdom with your guild.\n(After Kensho walks over to the tavern)\nKensho Arrowsoul: Greetings, tavernmaster. May the winds lift you to glory.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Winds...? Uh, well, thank you. May the winds lift you...a beer.\nKensho Arrowsoul: Beer, you say? Ah, yes. I would like some of this beverage. Thank you for your offer.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: Before you drink anything, I should ask you-have you had beer before?\nKensho Arrowsoul: Only once, when celebrating the death of Zhaitan with some norn in our trading post. It is...quite pleasant, this beer.\nGamli Aðalsteinnson: We're going to get along just fine.\nAfter Mine Excavation 2\nRekka: Excellent. Expanding the mine will allow us to increase production!\nRekka: We're definitely going to need more aetherium storage tanks.\nAfter Mine Excavation 3\nRekka: I'm very pleased. This place is finally starting to look like a functional mine.\nRekka: Since we have the space, I'm thinking we should move the miners' beds in here. Get rid of that wasted travel time!\nAfter War Room Restoration 2\nSophia Carriker: Finally finished! It's a weight off my mind to see this place complete.\nSophia Carriker: New tactics, guild badges, soldiers, crafting... This will give the guild a fighting chance!\nSophia Carriker: I wish I could go out and fight, but those days are over for me.\nSophia Carriker: I'm content to stay in the war room and help where I can.\nSophia Carriker: Anytime you need me, I'll be here.\n\n\n== Crafting resources ==\nResource nodes\n Ore Synthesizer (Only with Ore Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Lumber Synthesizer (Only with Lumber Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Berry Synthesizer (Only with Plant Synthesizers 1 or better)\n Cloth Synthesizer (Only with Cloth Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Herb Synthesizer (Only with Plant Synthesizers 1 or better)\n Leather Synthesizer (Only with Leather Synthesizer 1 or better)\n Vegetable Synthesizer (Only with Plant Synthesizers 1 or better)\nFishing nodes\n Freshwater Fish\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nGetting there\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nTenebrous weapons require access to this guild hall to unlock.\nPlayers without the Heart of Thorns expansion cannot use the portal to Auric Basin.",

They will not attack you and die within a couple hits, so focus on hitting as many as you can with every hit, potentially using CC skills to gather them closer to each other for large hits.\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nYou can ignore skill 1 and skill 3. Skill 2 is your main attack skill. Just keep spamming skill 2 to kill groups of chak. You can use skill 4 when ever it is off cooldown inbetween skill 2 usages.

The order of the three colored guardians are randomized each run. Each of the divisions is constantly surrounded by Magic Aura, indicated by the very large red aoe circles surrounding them. Players will be dealt pulsing damage every few seconds while standing within the circle, depending on the player's health. It is recommended to fight only one at a time because the pulsing damage from each division stacks (compounding their damage), but it is possible to win against multiple divisions with sufficient coordination. Once a player steps within the aura, the division will start moving towards them.\nA Bullet Storm will also be present while fighting against the Vale Divisions. Light blue balls will spawn around the outer edges and slowly move towards a player. Players that touch one of these balls will be dealt a moderate amount of damage. These balls only travel in a straight line, so can be easily side stepped. Once each division's health has been depleted they will become immune to further damage and their defiance bar will become unlocked, which can only be depleted using crowd control skills. When the bar is broken the division will be defeated.\nEach Vale Guardian Division has at most two special mechanics, as listed in the following section.\n\n\n==== Red Guardian ====\n\nThe Red Guardian has extremely high toughness, rendering damage other than Condition Damage ineffective to the point of dealing single-digit damage.\n\nSpecial Mechanic - Summon Seekers\nThe Red Guardian will summon two red orbs called seekers every 15 seconds. Seekers will last 20 seconds before they disappear. When they spawn, they will slowly gravitate toward a random player and may change targets while en route. All players standing within a seeker's aoe will be dealt high damage continuously.\nSeekers have high health, making it extremely difficult and impractical to attempt to kill them before they disappear. Instead, it is suggested that players make use of knockbacks and pulls to keep them away, as well as effects such as chilled, cripple, or immobilize to impede their advance. Players using knockbacks or pulls should take care to not bring the Seekers towards other players.\n\n\n==== Green Guardian ====\n\nSpecial Mechanic - Unstable Magic Spike (Green Guardian)\nThe Green Guardian periodically creates small blue electric fields under nearby players every 10 seconds. The fields have a distinct sound effect, and will detonate after 2-3 seconds, causing any players standing inside them to be dealt a large amount of damage and teleported to a random location within its Magic Aura. This is dangerous as it can cause players to accidentally initiate combat with other guardians. A yellow border will be present around the player's screen while they are in contact with these fields.\nPlayers are recommended to either move out of the way or dodge before the fields detonate, or alternatively blocked to avoid the damage and teleport.\n\n\n==== Blue Guardian ====\n\nSpecial Mechanic -  Blue Pylon Power\nThe Blue Guardian will start with Blue Pylon Power, which makes it immune to damage. To remove this effect, the invulnerability must be stripped or corrupted. It will regain the Blue Pylon Power effect, as well as protection every 10 seconds.\n\nSpecial Mechanic - Distributed Magic (Blue Guardian)\nThe blue guardian will create a green circle in a random place within its aura every 15 seconds. Visually, a bright green circle shrinks from within the edges of a darker green circle. Once the bright green circle has disappeared, all players within the platform will be dealt a large amount of damage. In order to avoid this damage, a minimum of three players must be standing within the green circle. Doing so will distribute highly reduced damage among the players standing within the circle. Players have approximately 5 seconds to get enough people within the circle, or else suffer a devastating attack. Having less than the required amount of players will result in all nearby players suffering the attack. Do note that players that are downed or in mid-dodge animation will not count as being inside the circle.\n\n\n=== Vale Guardian ===\n\nHealth: 22,021,440\nEnrage Timer: 8 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged - Increases damage dealt by 200%.\nAfter defeating the Vale Divisions and moving forward, players will reach a circular battlefield with the Vale Guardian standing in the center. The battlefield is divided into three sections of equal size, wherein each third of the battlefield has a uniquely colored pylon along the outside edge and a uniquely designed rune tile in the center.\nThe Vale Guardian is an amalgamation of the three previous Vale Divisions. The following changes have been made to their unique mechanics:\n\nSeekers - A Seeker will spawn in the center of each tile around the arena and slowly gravitate towards a player. All Seekers will disappear after 20 seconds and a new set will spawn.\nUnstable Magic Spike (Vale Guardian) (also known as blue circles) - Will deal a large amount of damage and teleport you to a random place around the arena.\nDistributed Magic (Vale Guardian) (also known as green circles) - Requires a minimum of four players inside the green circle or else everyone in the arena will take 80% of their health as damage. These will only spawn in the section the Vale Guardian is standing in.\nPrior to the fight, it is recommended to designate the person who will hold the Vale Guardian's aggro, colloquially called the \"tank\". The Vale Guardian will target the player with the highest toughness out of all players within the arena. If another player gains higher toughness at any point during the fight, it will switch targets.\nThe Distributed Magic (green circle) attack can be dealt with two different ways. The first is to designate four players to go to greens so that the rest of the squad can focus on dealing damage. Players that can do ranged damage are preferred for this team, along with at least one healing profession. It is imperative for this team to be vigilant for when the green circles spawn, as failure to prevent the green circles might wipe your group. Therefore members of this team should stop whatever they are doing and get to these circles as quickly as possible. The second method is to have one or two high caliber healers to mitigate the damage the attack causes. This is only possible if the group stays together and no one gets teleported. Since the attack deals a set percentage of each player's health, healers should ensure everyone is at full health before the green pops, as well as quickly heal them back up afterwards. Additionally, the damage can be partially mitigated by  Barrier.\nA few seconds after a player attacks or gets close enough to the Vale Guardian, an impassable barrier will be erected around the battlefield, making it impossible to leave or to rejoin mid-fight. Players standing outside of the arena will be immediately killed.\n\nPhase 1\nOnce the fight has begun, the \"tank\" should try to keep the Vale Guardian in one place. The Vale Guardian's main attack is a punch, which cleaves; therefore, the tank should be the only one in front, and the rest should be in the back to avoid unnecessary damage.\nThere are a few common strategies for tanking Vale Guardian:\n\nTile Center: This strategy is commonly chosen if the squad chooses to have 4 players stand in every green. The tank tanks near the center of an edge of a tile, such as near a Speed Boost Mushroom, for the players that have trained the Blazing Speed Mushrooms mastery (note that the buffs given by the Speed Boost Mushroom do not stack with  Swiftness or  Quickness). This minimizes the distance that the party has to travel to any potential green spawn. It also ensures the party is as far away as possible from two of the seekers.\nLine: This strategy is commonly chosen if the squad chooses to outheal the green. The tank stands on the edge of the circle on a line between two tiles. This maximizes distance away from the seekers, so the squad has to deal with them as little as possible.\nCenter: This strategy is extremely risky and is only recommended if the squad can outheal the green and effectively deal with moving out and/or immobilizing the seekers. The tank will keep Vale Guardian standing in the center of the arena. Since this places the squad right in the center of the three seekers that spawn, players will have to actively manage keeping seekers away to avoid taking extremely heavy damage from them. Due to the speed at which seekers come back in, it is recommended that the squad have very high squad dps in order to effectively carry out this strategy, as squads with lower dps may have their seeker management skills on cooldown if the seekers come back in too many times. This strategy is commonly done to maximize dps and minimize kill time - since Vale Guardian is stationary in the middle the entire time, players do not have to either wait for or follow Vale Guardian as it walks out towards the tank.\nThroughout the fight, the Vale Guardian will continuously summon Seekers, use Unstable Magic Spike (Vale Guardian) (small blue circles), and spawn Distributed Magic (Vale Guardian) (green circles). Depending on your team composition, there are multiple ways of dealing with these situations.\n\nIt is possible for unfavorable scenarios to happen because of this, such as a Seeker spawning on top of a green circle, or blue circles on top of a green circle, or failing to avoid the Unstable Magic Spike and getting teleported on top of a Seeker, etc.\nSome common utilities for moving around seekers include a Chronomancer's Temporal Curtain (focus 4) and a Druid's Glyph of the Tides. Players can also immobilize them in place, such as with a Druid's Entangle and Natural Convergence.\nIn addition to moving out or dodging the blue circles, players can also block them to avoid the teleport. Note that each field handles its teleport separately, therefore if a player is standing on two fields at the same time, they might block the first field but still get teleported by the second field.\nThe 80% flat damage taken from green circles places very high pressure on the healers if the squad chooses to not do greens. However, because it is based off a percentage of the health bar, damage from the greens can also be mitigated with  Barrier. With some barrier, this alleviates some pressure on the healers, as healers do not have to keep every player perfectly topped off on health before the greens pop. Furthermore, players will generally have a lot more health after the green pops, which allows for more room of error afterwards too, such as seekers or blue circles deal damage as well.\nPhase 2\nAt 66% health, the Vale guardian will turn Invulnerable and start walking towards the center of the arena. During this time 2-3 players with Condition damage should go to the red pillar, one person to the green pillar, and the rest to the blue pillar. Shortly after, the Vale Guardian will disappear and spawn the three Vale Divisions at their respective pillar. Players will also gain Pylon Attunement: Red, Pylon Attunement: Green, or Pylon Attunement: Blue depending on which section they were standing in before the divisions spawn. All divisions will have their Magic Aura. Standing within the aura of the division that is not the same color as your attunement will result in heavy pulsing damage. Each Division functions similarly to how it was done prior to the Vale Guardian fight, but with significantly less health. The group should be able to defeat the Blue Guardian while the Green Guardian is being pulled over to the group. The Condition damage players should be able to defeat the Red Guardian at this point as well. Groups with higher dps may choose to split into three groups to defeat each of the guardians at once.\nTheir mechanics change slightly during this phase and will return to normal afterwards.\n\nSeekers (Red Guardian) - A Seeker will spawn at the rune in the center of that section. This Seeker can target any player within the arena, not just the ones nearby. A new one will spawn every 15 seconds and last 20 seconds before disappearing.\nUnstable Magic Spike (Green Guardian) - The blue circles will only spawn for the players nearby, however they will teleport players within them anywhere around the arena. Players should take care because they can be teleported to the other guardians.\nDistributed Magic (Blue Guardian) - Drops down to three players within this phase. Will deal a 80% to each player in the arena if there are not enough people.\nPhase 3\nOnce all 3 Vale Divisions are defeated, the Vale Guardian reappears in the center of the arena. During this phase, the green pylon's section will be affected by Unstable Pylon, indicated by the lit up floor, which deals 2000 damage every second to players standing within. This damage is unaffected by damage reduction like protection. Every 20 seconds, the section that is lit by Unstable Pylon will rotate clockwise. This means that it is unfeasible to stand in one place, unlike the first phase. The \"tank\" must continuously move the Vale Guardian during this phase to avoid having the green circle spawn in the lit up section. While it is possible to successfully clear the green circle if this happens, it is extremely difficult to come out of it unscathed. Players should also try to avoid the blue circles during this phase, as it is possible to get teleported into the lit up section.\nThere are 3 methods to deal with the floor:\n\nAround-the-world method — Starting at the border of the red and green sections, the \"tank\" should try their best to stay to the left of the lit floor, and move to the next once when it becomes safe. Due to the timing of floor changing and the spawn time of the green circles, it is possible to have two or more green circles spawn in a section before moving to the next one. Moving onto a lit section early is more preferred than getting there too late. This mindset becomes much more important in the final phase. This option is safer due to always being two sections ahead of the floor but slower because you need to keep moving.\nLine method — Starting at the border between any two sections, the \"tank\" keeps the Vale Guardian to the right of the border until just before the floor changes onto their current section. Before it happens the \"tank\" moves over the line to the now safe section before moving back after it has passed. Like the above method, moving onto the lit section early is preferable to late, however moving too early may cause the green circles to spawn in the lit section so timing is important. If it happens to spawn in the wrong section, players should not attempt to go for it and the healers should make sure everyone is above 80% health and brace for the incoming damage. This option is faster due to the Vale Guardian being stationary for longer but more dangerous due to the timing required and possible distance to reach the green circles.\nCenter method — For this method, the \"tank\" keeps the Vale Guardian in the center, only needing to move to the safe section so the Vale Guardian doesn't attack anyone else. This method is the fastest but also most dangerous due to the green circles being able to spawn in any section. It is also possible for all three seekers to converge on your location.\nThe Vale Guardian will gain a new attack during this phase - Magic Storm. The Vale Guardian will stop moving and throw its fist in the air, flinging out balls of energy randomly around the arena. Its defiance bar will also unlock at this time. Players should try to break the bar as quickly as possible, because taking too long may cause the green circle to spawn in the lit up section. The Vale Guardian will automatically stop this attack after 20 seconds or if the lit up section changes (whichever happens first). However, if this happens the green circle will certainly spawn in the lit up section. A green circle cannot spawn while his defiance bar is up.\n\nPhase 4\nThe fourth phase starts when the Vale Guardian reaches 33% and is exactly the same as the second phase.\n\nPhase 5\nOnce all 3 Vale Divisions are defeated for the last time, the Vale Guardian reappears in the center of the arena. In general, this final phase is very similar to the third phase. The most notable difference is that an additional section of the arena will be affected by Unstable Pylon. Initially, the red pylon's section will be safe. The lit up sections will also rotate every 17 seconds (down from 20).\nDue to this timing change, having two or more green circles spawn in a section becomes a lot more dangerous. The \"tank\" should attempt to move the Vale Guardian to the next section (regardless of whether it's lit or not) as soon as the green circle gets cleared. The Magic Storm attack also becomes a lot more dangerous because the Vale Guardian will not move. Taking too long to break its defiance bar will certainly cause a green circle to spawn in the (now) newly lit up section.\nThe following changes will happen to the special mechanics:\n\nSeekers - An additional Seeker will spawn in the center of the arena, along with one at each of the runes in the center of each section. There will be a total of 4 Seekers up at any time.\nUnstable Magic Spike (also known as blue circles) - Will target all players regardless of proximity. Players that are part of the green circle team should try to avoid standing on it until they are certain that this will not spawn under them.\nDistributed Magic (also known as green circles) - No change, but the above two changes will make it slightly harder to deal with. Having a back up will help.\n\n\n=== Spirit Woods ===\n\nPart 1 - Spectral Rifts\nAfter defeating the Vale Guardian, players get access to the encounter Spirit Woods and need to complete tasks to open gates and progress. To open the first gate, players must first kill all the spirits in the area to trigger the event.\nAfter all the spirits are defeated Spectral Rifts will begin to spawn in addition to more spirits. Players have to stand inside of the Spectral Rifts for a period of time to close them and prevent them from dealing massive damage to all players, often wiping the run. The more players present in a given rift the faster its progress bar will move. Progress bars for each rift, as well as the overall progress on the encounter, can be seen in the upper right hand portion of the screen. The rifts spawn randomly in fixed locations. Two at east (near the River of Souls), one at north (near the gate), another at south (near the stairs) and another at west. Orange AoE attacks will spawn throughout the area and can knock players down. Faster movement skills, stability, and stun breaks are very useful to avoid this. Portal skills are very valuable here to cross large distances. There are also Adrenal Mushrooms that can be used to lower skill cooldowns if the mastery has been completed.\nAfter opening the first gate, players enter the Abandoned Outpost. Killing all the spirits here opens the second gate. The brazier can be picked up and carried throughout the encounter to complete the Keep the Lights On achievement, and for access to the third hidden chest. Note, if the player holding the torch gets downed or killed or weapon swaps during the rest of the encounter the torch is lost.\n\nPart 2 - Spirit Race\nThis part needs to be done as fast as possible. After landing from the ledge of the second gate, a massive wall of ghosts will start chasing the players. Players must close the Spectral Rifts while destroying the Ethereal Barriers. The first and second parts have 1 rift, the third part has 2 rifts and the fourth part has 3 rifts. Often 2-4 support players will stand in these to ensure all rifts get closed and the barriers destroyed.\n\nPart 3 - Cemetery\nAt Bandit's Rest, 5 players need to stand on top of 5 ground pads to open the final gate. The first is past the staircase to the left in a small alcove. The rest of the group typically then attempt the jumping puzzle across the branch and mushrooms to reach the highest pad next to the gate. Once one person is successful there is a small building below that pad that contains the third one. The fourth is reached by going up the stairs to the left, the same ones used to reach the jumping puzzle, and continuing past the tree branch jump down to the lower ledge. The final pad is also to the right side of the area behind some buildings after going up the much smaller staircase. Once each of these pads has a person standing on it all at the same time the gate will open and the encounter will be completed. Note, a downed or defeated player cannot activate a button.\n\n\n=== Gorseval the Multifarious ===\nHealth: 21,628,200\nEnrage Timer: 7 minutes\nEnrage Effect: Removes all updrafts and gains  Enraged, Increases damage dealt by 200%.\nPhase 1\nTo start the fight, players must glide onto the platform. Gorseval won't attack until the first person gets near it, so it is recommended to glide to the edge of the platform. Once the fight starts, Spirit Barriers will be erected around the platform and four updrafts will spawn in each corner.\nGorseval has two main attacks he will use throughout the fight: a swipe, which deals a small amount of damage to players in front; and a slam, which deals a moderate amount of damage and  knocks back all nearby players. When you see it raise his arm high in the air, it is recommended to either block it with  Aegis or  Stability, or dodge it.\nEvery once in a while he will teleport to the center of the platform and start channeling his Ghostly Rampage attack. During this time, Gorseval will gain a defiance bar and  Vivid Echo, which functions similarly to retaliation. While channeling this skill, parts of the arena will be filled with black goop in a set pattern which detonates after a few seconds. Players standing within the goop when it detonates will be dealt a large amount of damage and receive 25 stacks of  Vulnerability. At the end of the channel, the entire platform will be covered in the black goop. Breaking the defiance bar will knockdown Gorseval and interrupt the attack; any black goop remaining after this attack was interrupted will still detonate. After this attack finishes, Gorseval will summon four Angered and/or an Enraged Spirit.\nA short while after Ghostly Rampage ends, Gorseval channels the World Eater attack. A red circle will start expanding from the center of the platform, and once it completely fills the platform, all players and spirits still standing on the platform are instantly killed. In order to avoid this attack, players will need to reach the next phase by bringing Gorseval's health down to 66%, or destroy a spirit barrier and glide into an updraft before returning to the platform. Gorseval will gain one stack of  Spirited Fusion for each spirit killed by this attack, therefore it is recommended to kill all spirits before gliding off. Shortly after returning, Gorseval will channel his Ghostly Rampage attack again.\n\nSpirit Phase\nWhen Gorseval reaches 66% HP he will gain  Protective Shadow, making him invulnerable, and move to the center. Four Charged Souls will spawn, each in a different part of the platform (northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest) and begin walking towards Gorseval. If a spirit reaches Gorseval, he will immediately begin his World Eater attack. The spirits are immune to hard crowd control effects such as knockback or daze, but are susceptible to soft crowd control.  Immobile,  Chilled and  Crippled work very well for slowing the spirit's progress towards Gorseval. Once all four spirits have been killed, Gorseval becomes vulnerable once again and the fight moves to the next phase.\n\nPhase 2\nThis phase is the same as Phase 1 with one additional mechanic:  Spectral Darkness (also known as orbs), which spawn periodically. They will emanate a circle that slowly increases in size. Any player that touches this circle will receive 10 stacks of  Spectral Darkness, which reduces their outgoing damage by 10% per stack, and increases incoming damage by 10% per stack. To remove the effect, players must walk over golden orbs which spawn after an orb is destroyed. Each orb will drop two when it is destroyed, and each golden orb that you pick up will remove five stacks of Spectral Darkness.\nKeeping the orbs under control in this phase is very important. Players should focus on destroying the ones that have spawned close to the center, by the Charged Souls or towards an updraft. Once Gorseval reaches 33% health there will be another Spirit Phase. It will largely be the same as last time, but with orbs spawning throughout.\n\nPhase 3\nIn addition to the orbs, Gorseval gains another attack:  Ghastly Prison. After using his slam, small circles will appear under every player's feet. After a second, players standing within these circles will be encased in a cocoon. Players trapped in a Ghastly Prison will lose access to all of their skills and must break out of the prison using the skill   Rebel (default: 1). Players that are not trapped within a Ghastly Prison may help break them out by dealing damage to it. The pattern of Gorseval's Ghostly Rampage attack also changes during this phase. The fight continues in this way until Gorseval is defeated.\n\n\n=== Bandits ===\nAfter finishing the second boss of the raid, players will need to glide down to a nearby bandit camp. While passing through it, players will occasionally get tagged with Sapper Bombs (indicated by green circles under the players' feet). Players receiving the Sapper Bomb will also see the option to throw the bomb via their Special action key (default: -). Sapper bombs thrown on the launch pad will launch all players standing on said launch pad at the moment of impact. Players without the Explosive Launch mastery will be dealt a moderate amount of damage.\nThis event is good to learn how to throw Sapper Bombs and use launch pads. Killing all the Bandits here opens the Sabetha fight.\n\n\n=== Sabetha the Saboteur ===\nHealth: 34,015,256\nEnrage Timer: 9 minutes\nEnrage Effect: All four cannons become active and gains  Enraged, increasing outgoing damage by 500%\nIn addition to the enrage timer encountered in the Vale Guardian and Gorseval the Multifarious fights, the Sabetha encounter also has a bar showing the platform health. If the platform is completely destroyed during the fight, players will fall to their deaths resulting in a failure. Besides her shotgun attack, which deals a small amount of damage to all players in front of her, bandits will spawn throughout the fight. They have special attacks such as a kick that knocks players back and a flamethrower attack that deals damage very quickly.\nThere are four special mechanics that will repeat throughout the fight: a flak attack, a timed bomb, a flamewall and cannons.\n\nFlak Shot\nThe flak attack will always target the furthest player from herself. As such it is important to have one dedicated 'flak kiter' - a player who will move around the edges of the arena in order to keep the deadly flak off the rest of the team. Sabetha will alternate between both flak and shotgun consistently throughout the fight, using one attack, and then the other until another mechanic happens.\n\nTime bomb\nAt the start of each Sabetha phase and every 15 seconds (except during a Flamewall),  Time Bomb will always be placed on the player closest to Sabetha. The selected player will have a large circle around them, with an inner circle that will slowly expand until the entire circle is filled. Once filled, the player it was placed on will take a small amount of damage. All other players within the circle will be dealt a large amount of damage. This damage cannot be dodged or evaded, but it can be blocked. Players with the time bomb should run away from the group until it has gone off before returning to the group.\n\nFlamewall\nEvery 45 seconds Sabetha will draw an arrow in the direction of a random player and spawn a flamewall. This flamewall will rotate 360 degrees counter-clockwise around the platform in slow motion. All players that touch the wall will be immediately defeated. The flamewall cannot be evaded or blocked; a very lucky evade frame might keep players alive, but this is not to be relied upon. Players can, however, use invulnerability through the flamewall if timed correctly as well. If Bandit Thugs are up, players should take care to not get kicked into the path of the flamewall. Additionally, if Sabetha hasn't returned during her 45 seconds flamewall cooldown, it will always be her first mechanic when she returns, and it will always roughly be aimed in the direction of the entrance bridge instead of a random player.\nThe flamewall can be outrun if you are close enough to Sabetha, but you can minimize your movement if you stand to the left of the arrow, then move back to the right once the wall is far enough away. Although the flamewall may not seem to move fast for players near Sabetha, due to angular velocity players near the outer edge will see the wall move very quickly relative to the center, making it extremely difficult to outrun. Any players on the outer edge are therefore advised to move in as close as possible in order to avoid the attack.\n\nCannons and Sapper bombs\nThroughout the fight cannons will spawn every 30 seconds in a fixed pattern, which alternate after the previous one has finished:\n\nSouth → West → North → East\nFollowed by:\n\nSouth → North → West → East\nThe cannon will fire down at the platform dealing damage to it and making it dangerous to stand in that quadrant of the arena. The more cannons that are up, the more damage the platform will take.\nA Bandit Sapper will spawn periodically on the side of the platform opposite of the next cannon. They will mark the west-most player within their range and give them a special action skill   Sapper Bomb, which are used to launch players up to the cannons. Players that have the the sapper bomb are marked by a green circle under them. The sapper bomb will time out after a few seconds. Sapper bombs must be thrown on the jump pads located at the four corners of the platform. All players standing on the launch pads at the time will be sent up to the platform where a cannon spawns.\nPlayers that have been launched will the afflicted with  Shell-Shocked, rendering them unable to be launched by another sapper bomb for 50 seconds. This means a minimum of 2 players are required in order to deal with the cannons as they come up. Less experienced groups can use four players, one for each direction. Players on cannon duty are recommended (but not required) to use teleport and other movement skills to reach the launch pads more quickly. Players without the Explosive Launch mastery will take damage when launched by the sapper bomb.\nOnce on the platform with the cannon, the player should fully destroy the cannon before gliding back to the main platform. There will be a Bandit Sniper on an unreachable platform that will constantly fire at them. Being hit by the sniper will apply  Target!, causing them to take increased damage from subsequent attacks. Taking too long to destroy the cannon will cause them to go downed to the sniper, either while on the platform or while gliding back. The sniper can be killed, but it is not worth the trouble. Players should watch for the flamewall while gliding back. There is a small updraft that players can use to wait until the flamewall passes, but it can only be used once.\nWhen the fight begins players should immediately make their way to Sabetha and position themselves in front of the south launch pad and prepare to launch the first player up to the cannons when it spawns. The first flamewall will coincide with the first cannon spawn, so it is best to wait until the flamewall passes over the launch pad before sending the player up. If the player was not able to be sent up (by either missing the launch pad or the bomb timing out) then players should wait for the sapper to give players the next bomb. If the sapper was killed before this could happen then the cannon should be skipped. After sending them up, the group should move to position themselves for the next cannon spawn. Groups will frequently stack on the side of Sabetha where the next cannon will spawn, so as to minimize movement for the cannon-goer if a flamewall spawns on group. If possible, players should pull the remaining bandits nearby and kill them to prevent being overrun.\n\nBandit Champions\nAt 75%, 50% and 25%, Sabetha will shadowstep off the platform and one of her champions will take her place. Each champion has their own unique attack that needs to be avoided. While Sabetha is away, players will not need to worry about flak, timed bombs or her flamewall. Cannons must be continued to be dealt with. While on the cannon platforms, Sabetha may be there too, however she will be invulnerable and ignore the player. Once her champion has reached 25% health or a minute has passed, Sabetha will return to the platform and immediately use her flamewall. Her champion should be prioritized before turning your attention back to her.\n\nHeavy Bombs\nWhile fighting her champions, Sabetha will toss Heavy Bombs onto the platform. These bombs will spawn randomly on the platform and have a timer above them which will slowly fill up. Once filled, they will explode and deal a large amount of damage to the platform. They will also knock nearby players back. Players can kick the bombs away using their interact key (default: F).\n\nKernan\nHealth: 3,440,850\nAt 75% health, Sabetha will shadowstep off the platform and her first champion, Kernan, will take her place. Unlike Sabetha, Kernan can chase players around the platform. Kernan's main attack is to shoot a player for a small amount of damage. Every few seconds she will fire three consecutive cone attacks in one direction. Each one will cover a larger area than the last and deal more damage. The third shot of this attack will deal the most damage. Because this attack only goes in one direction, players can step to the side or go behind her to avoid the attack. Alternatively, they can be evaded or blocked.\n\n\"Knuckles\"\nHealth: 3,440,850\nAt 50% health, Sabetha will leave and summon \"Knuckles\". His main attack is to swing his hammer at players; dealing a small amount of damage. Every 30 seconds, \"Knuckles\" will charge up a hammer swing with the hammer over his shoulder and unlock his Defiance bar. Fail to break this bar and \"Knuckles\" will knock all players up and push them outwards. It is possible to be knocked off the platform by this attack. If players find themselves getting hit by this attack, they should immediately try to deploy their glider while in the air to avoid the knockback.\nAfter Sabetha has returned, she will start using  Time Bomb on the two nearest players instead of one. These two players should try not to go in the same direction, lest they blow up each other. There is a short delay until the second player gets their bomb.\n\nKarde\nHealth: 4,423,950\nAt 25% health, Sabetha will withdraw once more leaving Karde in her place. Karde possess two abilities which are of great concern to the player group. First is Karde's flamethrower attack, which inflicts damage extremely quickly to all players in front of him. Additionally, Karde will periodically summon flame turrets which shoot out projectiles. If these are not dealt with quickly, they will grow in number and quickly become unmanageable.\nAfter Sabetha returns, she will begin to use Platform Crush, an ability which causes debris to fall from the sky, marked by small circles on the ground. Being hit deals a small amount of damage. Once Karde has been defeated, it is a race between whether Sabetha is defeated or the platform gets destroyed.\n\nEnrage\nIf her enrage timer runs out she will become Enraged and all four cannons will spawn.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nScholar Glenna\nCharr\nVeteran Vigil Medic\nWhispers Agent\nInsect\nBeetle\nNorn\nSquad Leader Falgeir\nSylvari\nPriory Explorer\nVarious\nPact Prisoner\nVigil Crusader\nVigil Recruit\nVigil Warmaster\nWhispers Slayer\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nBandits\nBandit Arsonist\nBandit Sapper\nBandit Sniper\nBandit Thug\nKarde\nKernan\n\"Knuckles\"\nSabetha the Saboteur (boss)\nGhosts\nAngered Spirit\nChampion Angered Spirit\nDeranged Spirit\nChampion Deranged Spirit\nEnraged Spirit\nChampion Enraged Spirit\nGorseval the Multifarious (boss)\nElementals\nBlue Guardian\nGreen Guardian\nRed Guardian\nVale Guardian (boss)\nSaurians\nPocket Raptor\nUnknown\nEast Cannon\nNorth Cannon\nSouth Cannon\nWest Cannon\n\n\n== Objects ==\nAnvil\nCooking Station\nDead bandit\nFallen Pact Soldier\nGravestone\nJournal Entry\nLey Rift\nMap\nPact Scout\nPaper\nTent\nWooden Plank\nChests\nGuardian Chest\nGorseval's Chest\nHidden chest\nSabetha's Chest\nMushrooms\nAdrenal Mushroom\nBouncing Mushroom\nSpeed Boost Mushroom\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\nUpon entering and passing the pact camp, one of the following\n\n<Squad member>: Let's get to work.\n<Squad member>: All right. Let's find these soldiers.\nApproaching Squad Leader Falgeir\n\nSquad Leader Falgeir has multiple possible ambient dialogues at this point.\nOne of these lines:\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Bandits attacked our platoon, inflicted heavy casualties on us. They captured one of our squads and went that way.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Our platoon was ambushed. The enemy captured an entire squad and took them deep into the woods.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: They took our squad hostage and brought them deeper into the woods.

They killed some of our soldiers and took the rest hostage. We need to find them.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Before you ask, no, I'm not the missing recon squad leader. Nothing's ever easy, right?\nFollowed by one of these lines:\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Be careful. Sabetha won't think twice about burning you alive if you make it into the woods.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Find our squad. Sabetha will kill them if you don't reach them in time.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Sabetha took the squad straight ahead. Her sentries are blocking the way. Get ready for a serious fight.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Stay alert out there. Sabetha is ruthless, and her defenses are like nothing I've seen before.\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Watch yourself on the battlefield. Sabetha and her crew fight dirty. Her guardians are lethal.\nUpon approaching the Guardians, one of the following\n\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Why don't they die? Where are they coming from?\nSquad Leader Falgeir: We keep killing them and they keep coming back. How is that possible?\nSquad Leader Falgeir: Cease fire!

We need to find a way to operate them at the same time.\nOpening the gate\nOne of the following:\n<Squad member>: These spirits have wandered for years.

Similar to the cat in Scholar's Cleft, it is not an NPC, as it has no overhead name and cannot be clicked on, is a unique model and is mostly likely the cat of one of the game's designers. However unlike the Scholar's Cleft cat, this cat only shakes its head and makes no other movement.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Spirit Vale\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial release page",

Players can choose to either kill the slublings and Evolved Slublings, or run past them and immediately begin the Slothasor encounter. Both types of slublings spit projectiles that apply conditions and corrupt boons.\n\n\n=== Slothasor ===\n\n\n==== Arena (Slothasor's Den) ====\nThe majority of the arena is covered in a series of overlapping green poison fields emanating from Poison Mushrooms. This poison fields quickly applies heavily damaging poisoned stacks. The encounter begins once a player eats the first Imbued Mushroom.\n\nPoison Mushrooms\nPoison Mushrooms cannot be destroyed or remove by regular player skills or utilities; however, they can be eaten by slublings. The green poison field disappears when its poison mushroom is consumed.\n\nPoison mushrooms (and consequently their poison fields) re-spawn 60 seconds after being eaten.\n\nImbued Mushrooms\nImbued Mushrooms are blue glowing mushrooms which spawn in four fixed locations in the arena. A mushroom spawns every 50 seconds starting at the beginning of the arena and rotating counter-clockwise. Each mushroom can be consumed by at most once by players each time it spawns.\nAny player that eats the mushroom will be magically transformed into a slubling for 45 seconds. While transformed, the player becomes hostile to the other players and friendly to Slothasor and other slublings. The transformed slubling can   Eat the poison mushrooms to clear a small area from the poison and create a safe route to where the next Imbued Mushroom spawns. After the transformation ends, the player becomes  Nauseated and cannot eat another Imbued Mushroom for 4 minutes.\n\nTip: Avoid attacking the player that is transformed.\nSlublings & Evolved Slublings\n\nSlublings spawn in groups of 5 every 30 seconds at the start, then every 20 seconds under 4 minutes, and finally every 15 seconds under 2 minutes. Slublings stop spawning after enrage. Skills with projectile reflection or projectile destruction/conversion are recommended for use in order to prevent them from applying heavy conditions.\nEvolved Slublings begin spawning once the boss is at 25% health or lower. Their poison projectiles cannot be blocked and corrupt boons on player characters. They can be pulled together and cleaved down like normal Slublings, but it is more effective to focus on killing the boss and staying alive before too many spawn.\n\nTip: It is recommended to bring a mesmer with a focus in order to pull the slublings together so they can be cleaved down.\nTip: It may be useful to bring necromancers for Epidemic and condition clear with Plague Signet, but they need to take extra care to not spread conditions to the allied slubling.\n\n\n==== Slothasor (Boss) ====\nHealth: 18,973,828\nEnrage Timer: 7 minutes\nEnrage Effect: Imbued Mushrooms stop spawning and gains  Enraged - Increases damage dealt by 200%.\nPlayer Effects\n Fixated - Slothasor will fixate on one random (non-transformed) player at a time.\nThe fixated player has a diamond-shaped purple marker  above their head.\nThe fixation will be chosen anew every 30 seconds (the same person may be chosen multiple times in a row).\nIf the fixated player consumes an Imbued Mushroom, or is downed, or gains stealth, Slothasor will fixate on a different player.\n Volatile Poison - Slothasor will mark one random (non-transformed) player with Volatile Poison (effect), which, when dropped, will spawn a slowly expanding AoE that deals massive damage to anyone standing in it. This field will grow up to a radius of 900 units and disappears 90 seconds after the player was marked with volatile poison.\nTimer: Every 25 seconds (starting at 6:35)\nThe player with volatile poison will have a green skull above their head  and the game will play an audio cue for that player.\nThe player may use the special action skill   Purge (default: -) to immediately drop the Volatile Poison, otherwise it will automatically drop after 8 seconds.\nIf the player consumes an Imbued Mushroom, or is downed, they will automatically drop the poison at their location.\nTip: It is imperative to drop this away from the group, behind, at the furthest cleared area (similar mechanic to the Time Bomb of Sabetha).\nBoss Mechanics\nTantrum - Slothasor halts and repeatedly pounds its fists on the ground.\nTimer: Every 45 seconds (starting at 6:45)\nSlothasor will spawn 3 consecutive Area of Effect circles under each non-transformed player, once about every half second. Any player still standing in a circle will be  knocked down for 5 seconds in addition to any damage taken.\nTip: In order to prevent it from covering the limited cleared space, players should stand still and dodge when the third set of circles appear.\nHalitosis - Slothasor halts and directs a cone of flame at the last known position of the fixated player.\nThis is a channelled attack that will apply stacks of  Burning (up to 8 stacks).\nNarcolepsy - Slothasor halts and falls asleep.\nTimer: Every 20% of its health and one extra time at the last 10%\nSlothasor become immune to any form of damage and will gain a defiance bar. Once the defiance bar is broken, Slothasor will Fear the entire squad, lasting 10 seconds.\nTip:  Stability,  Aegis or  Stunbreaks must be used to deal with this mechanic, or else players will be feared into the poisoned areas and subsequently go down. If the squad decides to use aegis or stability to counter the attack, they should be mindful to not get the aegis stripped from standing on poison, or from getting corrupted from the Slublings.\nSpore Release - Slothasor halts and shakes its entire body.\nTimer: Every 40 seconds (starting at 50% of its health)\nSlothasor will fire projectiles in arcing trajectories at the position of nearby players\nThese projectiles will apply heavy stacks of  Torment,  Burning and  Poisoned as well as direct damage.\nThese projectiles cannot be reflected or destroyed, however it is possible to block, evade, or go invulnerable in order to mitigate their damage and effects.\nTip: These projectiles move in an arc and so it's typically ideal to dodge towards Slothasor-and consequently through the barrage of spores. Alternatively, a class with a few seconds of invulnerability can stand in the middle of the hitbox and jump repeatedly to \"absorb\" the projectiles.\n\n\n==== General Strategy (Slothasor) ====\nThe transformed player should clear the poison mushrooms in a counter-clockwise path around the arena. There are two common routes that the player clearing mushrooms takes.\nOne is to eat mushrooms closer to the middle, clearing the path in an \"hourglass\" shape. This route makes it very easy to pull the slublings together to cleave them all down, as the fight stays near the middle where the slublings spawn. When going on this inside route, care must be taken to drop volatile poison along the edge of the wall or they will make the far side of the path impossible to survive on.\nThe other route is to eat the outermost mushrooms around the room, where it's easier to drop volatile poisons safely — they can be dropped anywhere back along the path since it's already along the wall — but with a harder time keeping the slublings cleared.\nThe route that's taken should be chosen based on group comfort and composition, and it's viable to start with the outside strategy and then transition to the inside one after more slublings spawn.\nThe fixated player should lead Slothasor along the path which the transformed player has previously cleared.\nThe non-fixated players in the squad should stay behind Slothasor to avoid both the auto-attacks and Halitosis.\n\n\n=== Protect the caged prisoners ===\nThis encounter's mechanics are driven by a timer. The game sends out announcements of mechanics with enough lead time to get to the appropriate location to attend to them.\n\n\n==== Arena (Prison Camp) ====\n\nPrisoner Cage\nDefend this target throughout the encounter. If it dies, the encounter ends. Possible sources of damage to the cage include:\n\nUnnamed Bandit enemies. They will attack the cage if they are not attacking player characters.\nBandit Saboteurs specifically attack the cage with a heavy bomb that deals severe damage. Their CC bar unlocks when they reach the cage and start placing the bomb. Players can break the bar to interrupt them, or kill them.\nPlayers without the Nuhoch Stealth Detection mastery trained cannot see the saboteurs.\nChampion Bandits can attack the cage with AOE attacks.\nBerg's melee cone attack can hit the cage if he is close enough. Keep this boss away from the cage to avoid.\nZane's long cone attacks pose a greater threat to the cage if he is facing towards it. Keep this boss pointed away from the cage by standing between Zane and the South or East walls at all times.\nNarella's attacks do not damage the cage, but this phase has a lot of NPC enemies, mortars to handle, and Narella's fire tornados and conditions can affect players' ability to handle NPCs. Therefore, cage damage is more likely in this phase.\nMortar strikes are able to hit the cage multiple times. Their CC bar unlocks when they reach the building site and start placing the bomb. Players can break the bar to interrupt them, or kill the turret quickly to minimize damage.\nPlayer bombs triggered by the Special Action Key can damage the cage if targeted near or at the cage. Either use away from the cage, on a launch pad, or not at all.\nBeehive\nUse a ranged attack to knock down a beehive from a tree or bridge. This bundle can be picked up, dropped on the ground, and consumed with the skill   Beehive that spawns a Swarm of Bees that will attack nearby enemies. The bees are specifically effective towards Berg, giving him the  Targeted debuff. Beehives can also be thrown on Bandit Saboteurs to break their CC bar while planting the bomb.\nCollect beehives around the Arena and keep by the door opposite of the cage where Berg spawns. Use most beehives on Berg, but save a few for Narella's phase so the bees will assist with breaking Saboteurs' break bar in case the person assigned to CC'ing Saboteurs dies. A beehive thrown on top of the cage will single-handedly CC a saboteur trying to place a bomb.\n\nWarg Cages\nInteract with a cage to release the Tortured Warg trapped within. Wargs will target nearby enemies that are bleeding or focus on Zane to do bonus damage. Open cages on the south side to focus on Zane, then reserve the north cages for Narella.\n\nOil Kegs\nBundle of items sitting on the ground that can be picked up and dropped, or thrown with   Throw to inflict a fire AOE. Collect Oil Kegs and keep on the first ledge to the north near the Warg cages. Ranged player characters should throw kegs periodically on Narella from the first north ledge to inflict additional burning conditions, which are more effective on her.\n\nBombs\nPlayer characters will periodically be targeted by Bandit Sappers and receive a bomb that can be thrown using   Sapper Bomb with their Special Action Key, similar to the Sabetha encounter. Player characters can also selectively pick up bombs with the box of bombs near each Launch Pad. These bombs can be thrown at NPCs to deal extra damage, but consequently damage the cage if thrown near it. These bombs also launch players into the air on Launch Pads, and should be utilized to clear out NPCs in hard to reach areas and to leave the Arena to clear out NPCs that set up mortar turrets. They also damage the cage if they time out while near the cage.\n\nLaunch Pads\nThere are two Launch Pads in the Arena - one to the north and one to the south. Players can be launched into the air by using their Special Action Key while holding a bomb, received either from a Sapper or from the box of bombs near the Launch Pad. The north Launch Pad sends the player on top of the starting tower on the east side of the Arena. The south Launch Pad sends the player to the east outside the arena near where the launch pad outside the arena is. Launch area is a little larger than the actual pad. Make sure not to stand to close to avoid being thrown up by accident.\n\n\n==== Unnamed Bandits ====\nBandit Snipers\nSnipers place the  Target! effect on players that deals more damage to players as they continue to be hit, identical to the snipers from the Sabetha encounter. Four minutes after the snipers are killed, a new wave of snipers will respawn with half their initial HP and will take extra damage from reflects.\n\nBandits\nThroughout the encounter Bandit Clerics, Sappers, Assassins, Deathsayers, and Battlemages will come through each of the north, west, and east gates in waves of 3-6. Watch for red AoEs and the vast amount of CC abilities. Bandit Clerics will heal other bandits throughout the encounter. It is recommended to group all the bandits together or near the current Bandit Champion in order to clear the majority of them as fast as possible. During some of the Bandit Champions the bandits may aggro onto the cage, it is important to pull them away or kill them quickly (without getting additional enemies onto the cage) if they do this. Bringing a long range reflect (such as Wall of Reflection or Feedback) that can be dropped between sappers and the cage can help take pressure off as well.\n\nBandit Saboteurs\nSaboteurs are stealthed mobs (visible only with Nuhoch Stealth Detection) that can spawn from any gate. Saboteurs spawn in a fixed pattern, with one arriving midway through the fight with Berg, then a pause until midway through the fight with Zane before they start arriving every 30 seconds until near the end of the fight. They ignore all players and run straight for the prisoner cage. A message will appear every time one spawns, warning players that a Saboteur is on its way to the cage. Upon arrival, they will gain a breakbar (that has 200 strength) and begin planting a bomb. Players then have ten seconds to break the bar. If unsuccessful, the bomb deals 55% of the cage's health in damage. The bar can also be broken with the skill provided by beehives.\n\nMortars\nBandit Bombardiers will spawn every minute outside the fort. The first three will spawn to the southwest of the fort, and the fourth will spawn with one on top of the eastern tower and one on the high bridge to the north west of it. Depending on the player confidence, sending two people to deal with the fourth set of mortars can help improve success at stopping them from deploying. They will take 20 seconds to move to a location and will begin construction of mortars which will shoot into the fort. They need to be CC'ed while their breakbars are available. Once they reach their turret destination, they will go into a breakbar phase and will begin construction of the turrets. When the bar is broken, the bombardiers will stop the construction the turrets, and will run into the fort and behave like all the other bandits.\n\n\n==== Champion Bandits ====\nThe champion bandits spawn roughly every 2 minutes; their attacks can deal significant damage to the prisoner cage. It's recommended to kill each Champion Bandit before the next one spawns in order to prevent players from having to fight two at the same time. The encounter ends when all three champions have been defeated.\n\n\n===== Berg =====\nBerg will spawn at the east gate at 6:55.\n\nMordremoth's Smash - A channelled hammer AoE attack that hits in a large arc in front of him, but he will gain a defiance bar while channelling.\nBreaking Berg's defiance bar will stop the channelling and will daze him for 8 seconds.\nEnvironmental Weakness: Bees\nBeehives thrown at him will apply the  Not the Bees! debuff to damage him over time.[verification requested]\nThis debuff increases the window time of the defiance bar from 2 seconds to 4 seconds and increases the cooldown of Mordremoth's Smash from 5 seconds to 20 seconds.\n\n\n===== Zane =====\nZane will spawn at the south gate at 4:55.\n\nHail of Bullets - A triple cone-shaped attack (similar to Kernan from the Sabetha encounter), and just like Kernan's attack the third shot is extremely deadly.\nUnrelenting Assault - Every 18 seconds, he will shadowstep to the furthest player within a ~1000 range (similar to Mai Trin), leaving behind a blinding field.\nEnvironmental Weakness: Veteran Tortured Wargs\nWhen freed from their cages, these wargs will focus on enemies who are  Bleeding.\nThe wargs will exit the camp 45 seconds after being released.\n\n\n===== Narella =====\nNarella will spawn at the west gate at 2:55.\n\nFlak Shot - Narella targets the furthest player within range with this attack (similar to Sabetha's flak shots).\nFiery Tornado - Spawns a fiery tornado that will follow a player around for the duration it is up. These will toss players around.\nEnvironmental Weakness: Oil Slicks\nThe oil kegs will spawn oil slicks where thrown, which can be ignited using  Burning.\nLit oil slicks will add a stack of  Slow Burn that deals damage when moving and applies burning every 10 seconds onto Narella.\nTip: The effect does not stack, so it's usually best to evenly space out the kegs one at a time.\n\n\n==== General Strategy (Prison Camp encounter) ====\nInitial Preparation\nThe raid group usually gathers on top of the tower where they are launched by the Sapper Bomb from the platform in the south east. At the beginning of the encounter players must split up around the encampment to kill the initial Bandits. They should also gather the environmental items available in order to support the fight.\nA common strategy is to split the raid into two groups of five. One group goes across the suspended bridges, knocking down beehives and collecting the oil kegs while clearing the snipers. After the snipers are taken care of, that group should drop down (bringing the oil kegs with them) and join the lower group. The second group drops down to the ground and clears out the Sappers that start in the courtyard. After that they usually move east, where they stack by the closed door so that the snipers in the north and south walls will come down to be easily cleaved down.\nBoth groups are responsible for bringing in beehives and kegs, using the weapon swap to drop them in place rather than throwing them. Two beehives should be placed near the east gate in order to be ready for use on Berg, while the others should be placed nearer the cage for use during the fight with Narella. Oil kegs should be stacked at the edge of the platform in the north so that they can be thrown at Narella one at a time as the fight progresses.\n\nMortars\nThe first two groups of bombardiers each have only one mortar in them, while the third has three and the fourth has two. Because the mortar setup is staggered in the groups that have more than one, it is possible for a single person to handle breaking all of them. To make it easier to handle the set of three, a beehive can be carried out and thrown at one of the setup points.\n\nZane\nHis two skills makes it even more important than usual for everyone to stack in one spot away from the cage. Popular stack spots are immediately inside south gate where he spawns, between the two warg cages by the stairs, or at the base of the stairs.\nReleasing six wargs - four from the two sets of cages near the gates, and two from up the stairs (That can be released by the player who takes out the mortars on their way back in) should provide enough damage to defeat Zane before Narella spawns, and leaves two wargs to help provide damage against Narella. As the fight with Zane nears its end a saboteur will spawn, the group's dps is reasonable if Zane is defeated before the saboteur is vulnerable to being broken.\n\nNarella\nAnother source of damage can be the remaining wargs that were not released to attack Zane. Since the ones on the small platform in the north are nearest to Narella, they are commonly used for this purpose.\nTo free people's attention so they can focus on avoiding the fiery tornados and keeping dps up it is easiest to throw a beehive in front of the cage when Narella spawns. This will take care of saboteurs for its duration, and when the effect fades another beehive can be used. During this phase it is critical that flak shots not land on the cage and that mortars not be allowed to freely fire and damage it or the attempt will likely fail due to destruction of the cage. If dps is low, the fourth set of mortars may need to be dealt with, but if dps is good Narella should be defeated before or just as the final set of mortars starts up.\n\n\n=== Matthias Gabrel ===\nHealth: 25,953,840\nEnrage Timer: 10 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged - Increases damage dealt by 200%. Will no longer use Blood Sacrifice.\nPlayer Effects\n Corruption - Matthias will corrupt one random player, which surrounds them with a red AoE circle that damages all players.\nTimer: Every 30 seconds (starting at 9:55)\nThe corruption can be cleansed in one of the 4 Forsaken Thicket water fountains in the boss room. Once a fountain is used, it turns from clear to red and cannot be used to cleanse another poison for approximately 90 seconds. The first well used will be ready for use again after all of them have been used.\nIf the player does not have Forsaken Thicket Waters mastery, using a cleansing fountain during the fight against Matthias Gabrel deals heavy damage and stuns for 3 seconds.\n Unstable Blood Magic - Matthias will afflict one random player with Unstable Blood Magic, which, when dropped, will spawn a Well of the Profane (a large red AoE) at the player's feet (an identical mechanic to Volatile Poison in the Slothasor encounter). While this effect is active, the player takes damage. The well AoE will vanish after 90 seconds.\nTimer: Every 10 seconds (only during the Heat Wave phases)\nThe player with unstable blood magic will have a green skull above their head  and the game will play an audio cue for that player.\nThe player may use the special action skill   Purge (default: -) to immediately purge the Unstable Blood Magic, otherwise it will automatically drop after 8 seconds.\nTip: It's best to run to the edge of the room (between fountains) to drop the AoE. After dropping the AoE, the player may dodge to avoid being hit by the well.\nTip: Avoid dropping the skill in a water fountain.\n Zealous Benediction - An orange AoE circle will appear under the player, filling up over 5 seconds. (similar to Timer Bomb on Sabetha).\nAfter 5 seconds, the player will take a small amount of damage, but any other players in the AoE circle will be downed.\nTimer: Every 20 seconds (only during the Downpour and Abomination phases)\nAffects 5 players during Downpour and everyone (except corrupted players) during the Abomination phase.\nPlayers affected by Zealous Benediction cannot be corrupted which sometimes leads to skipping a corruption application.\nBoss Mechanics\n Blood Shield - Matthias shields himself and becomes invulnerable to most damage.\nTimer: Every 30 seconds before 40% health and every 50 seconds after transformation. Timer only starts once all stacks have been removed though.\nMatthias will fire Blood Shard projectiles at the same target as Oppressive Gaze. These projectiles will need to be reflected back to him to remove the 18 shield stacks.\nTip: It is highly recommended to not bring projectile destruction/conversion during this phase as it may override the projectile reflection.\nBlood Sacrifice - A red arrow will appear on one player's head and they will be teleported to the center of the room after 4 seconds. The player will gain a defiance bar and must be broken within 10 seconds to free the player or they will die.\nTimer: Every 45 seconds (starting at 9:45, but not during the Abomination phase)\nShards of Rage - Matthias spins in the air and slams down his staff down to the ground to shoot out a circle of projectiles.\nGetting hit by these projectiles will apply the  Blood Fueled to anyone hit.\nDuring the Abomination phase, he will shoot projectiles in arcing trajectories all over the room.\nTip: Avoid reflecting these projectile back to Matthias.\n\n\n==== Phase Mechanics ====\nThe environmental hazards vary according to the current weather attuned to by an unstable Matthias.\n\nPhase 1 - Ice\n Snowstorm - Periodically damages players. Reduces movement speed and applies  Chilled every 10 seconds.\nIcy Patch - Circles of ice periodically appear around the room. Walking over them chills the player and knocks them down. These patches are targetable and can cleared with burn.\nOppressive Gaze - Matthias spins his staff briefly and fires an orb of energy that does massive amount of damage.\nMatthias will aim this attack at the same target every time (but will switch if that player is no longer alive).\nUsed after his Shards of Rage attacks and after breaking his blood shield.[verification requested]\nTip: This attack can easily avoided by dodging or by standing behind him.\nPhase 2 - Fire\n Heat Wave - Periodically applies 3 stacks of  Burning to players. Damages players standing still for too long.\nFire Tornado - Fire tornadoes roam around the room, pulling-in and damaging any nearby players.\nIt is possible to escape these tornadoes by either stunbreaking and dodging away, or waiting through the attack.\n Unstable Blood Magic will be afflicted on one random player.\nPhase 3 - Storm\n Downpour - Periodically damages players. Movement increases stack count and applies 5 stacks of  Poisoned every 3⅓ seconds.\nWhen a player reaches 10 stacks, they will lose all stacks and gain  Unbalanced; if the player continues to move, they will be  knocked down, however, the debuff will be removed if the player does not move.\nTip: It is recommended for players to either avoid movement entirely, or conversely to move until they get the unstable effect, and then stop moving in order to negate the mechanic and be able to move at a key moment.\nStorm Cloud - A single large cloud slowly roams the room. Players standing will get damaged by Thunder and gains stacks of Downpour.\n Zealous Benediction will be afflicted on 5 random players.\n\nPhase 4 - Abomination\nMatthias' Power will become  Unstable and he will transform into a bloodstone-infused abomination.\n\nDuring this phase, Matthias will cycle through the Snowstorm, Heat Wave, and Downpour phases every 30 seconds, retaining all their mechanics.\nWhile transformed phase, Matthias will have an identical set of skills as prior to his transformation, however their effects will be increased in potency.\ne.g., all players are now tagged by bomb-like AoEs instead of 5, and his Oppressive Gaze attack deals even more damage.\nSurrender - A spirit will walk across the centre of the room in a straight path.\nThe spirits deal heavy damage if it walks through a player; this damage cannot be evaded but can be blocked.\nBelow 20% health, an additional spirit will spawn.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAnimals\nFrog\nTropical Bird\nAsura\n Scholar Glenna\nCanines\nVeteran Tortured Warg\nHumans\nCaptive\nPrisoner\nSquad Leader Bennett\nInsect\nBeetle\nMosquito\nSpider\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nCanines\nVeteran Warg\nBandits\nBandit Arsonist\nBandit Assassin\nBandit Battlemage\nBandit Brawler\nBandit Cleric\nBandit Deathsayer\nBandit Bombardier\nBandit Saboteur\nBandit Sapper\nBandit Sniper\nBandit Thug\nBerg (boss)\nNarella (boss)\nZane (boss)\nFungi\nVeteran Mushroom Bomber\nVeteran Mushroom Charger\nVeteran Mushroom Spike Thrower\nVeteran Mushroom Stomper\nElementals\nFiery Tornado\nIcy Patch\nStorm Cloud\nSaurians\nPocket Raptor\nSloths\nEvolved Slublings\nSlothasor (boss)\nSlublings\nWhite Mantle\nMatthias Gabrel (boss)\n\n\n== Objects ==\n\n\n=== Related to the Slothasor encounter ===\nImbued Mushroom\nGolden Slubling\n\n\n=== Related to Prison Camp Encounter ===\nBeehive\nBombs\nCage\nOil Keg\n\n\n=== Related to Matthias Gabrel encounter ===\nSoup Pot\n\n\n=== Books and Journals ===\nBandit Journal\nCrumpled Paper\nNarella's Journal\nPrison Logbook\nTorn Page\n\n\n=== Other ===\nAnvil\nAsura Gate\nBarrel\nBodies\nDagger\nGiant Beehive\nGravestone\nLey Rift\nMaguuma Mastery Insight\nMordrem Vine\nShard\n\n\n=== Chests ===\nBoss chests\nSlothasor Chest\nPrison-Camp Chest\nMatthias's Chest\nHidden chests\nHidden chest\n\n\n=== Mushrooms ===\nBouncing Mushroom\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\nEntering Salvation Pass:\n\n<Squad member>: According to intelligence, this cave system leads deeper into the complex.\n<Squad member>: The missing squad leader is somewhere inside, along with whatever else the bandits are guarding.\n<Squad member>: Keep your eyes open for anything that might lead us in the right direction-or tell us more about our enemy.\nAfter killing some Slublings:\n\n<Squad member>: Was that supposed to happen?\nApproaching Slothasor:\n\nOne of the following\n<Asura squad member>: Wonderful.\n<Asura squad member>: Look around for a way out of here.

Players push on to investigate the sinister reason behind the White Mantle enclave.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nUsing the portal in Lion's Arch Aerodrome. You must join a raid Squad before you can enter the portal.\nThe portal for entering the raid Forsaken Thicket is located in the far northeast corner of Verdant Brink. The in-game map shows an icon for the portal, which can be reached by heading east from Jaka Itzel Waypoint or north from Shipwreck Peak Waypoint. Players must be in a raid squad of up to 10 players prior to entering the portal.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nPoints of Interest\n Tunnel of Respite — \n Fountain of Cleansing — \n Zealot's Bastion — \n Twisted Castle — \n Temple of Awakening — \n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nTalk to Glenna.\nEscort Glenna to the stronghold's courtyard.\nGlenna  \nTurrets secured \nDefeat McLeod and breach the stronghold.\nDefeat McLeod.  \nDestroy Xera's creation.\nDestroy the Keep Construct.\nKeep Construct  \nTime remaining: 10:00\nTraverse the Twisted Castle.\nEnter the portal beyond the bell to confront Xera.\nDefeat Xera.\nXera  \nTime remaining: 11:00\nStay ahead of Xera. Destroy charged bloodstones to manifest ley lines.\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\n\n\n=== Siege the Stronghold ===\nGlenna must be escorted to the stronghold's courtyard.\nTo begin the encounter, one player must interact with her and select the option Let's start the mission. Once the encounter has started, players will remain in combat until they have killed McLeod the Silent and opened the final gate.\nIt is recommended to split the squad into two groups prior to starting this encounter: a Tower group and an Escort group. It is imperative that all members of the tower group have the Bouncing Mushroom, Ley Line Gliding and Forsaken Thicket Waters masteries. Their roles will be explained below.\n\nInitial Mechanics\nThe most important thing to note is that if Glenna dies, the encounter will fail. There is no time limit, so players may spend as long as they want.\nOnce the encounter has begun, Glenna will gain 15 stacks of  Surveilled. Glenna will lose one stack every second if a player is not within 1000 range of her. Once a player is within range, her stacks will start to regenerate. If it reaches 0, five White Mantle Seekers will spawn and proceed to kill her. These should be dispatched quickly if they happen to spawn.\nAll players will gain the special action skill   Over Here! (Default key: -) that they can use to call Glenna to their current position. The range of this skill is 1500 units so it can be used outside of the range needed to prevent her stacks from going down (not recommended). Using the skill will also prevent her stacks from increasing or decreasing until she has stopped moving. Using this skill is required to proceed through the encounter.\nThe first obstacle is a lowered drawbridge. At the base of the drawbridge is a white glowing circle. When Glenna is called to stand in the circle she will cast a spell to summon a ley line. Players will need to cross the gap and interact with a lever to raise the drawbridge, allowing Glenna to cross. After the drawbridge raised, players will need to call Glenna to the gate so that she may blow it open. Be wary of the explosion as it will down any players caught in its blast. Subsequent runs will have this already completed, allowing players to wait at the gate before starting the encounter.\nOnce players have crossed the gate, the encounter begins.\nA red orb will spawn which will summon White Mantle shortly after. This group should be dispatched so that Glenna may safely join up with the group. Once this group is defeated, players should split into their respective groups: a Tower group and an Escort group. Both groups will need to proceed with coordinated effort in order for this encounter to succeed.\n\nTower Group\nThe tower group must first head through the Tunnel of Respite. While running through the tunnel players will be afflicted with  Toxic Spores, which reduces healing and deals a small amount of damage every second. Walking through Thicket Waters (requiring the Forsaken Thicket Waters) will give players  Healing Cleanse which will slightly heal them and make them immune to the effects of toxic spores. Within the tunnel are also multiple Mushroom foes that will attempt to slow players down. Depending on the group's composition, experience, and strategy, they may either be killed or ignored. Once the tunnel is cleared, a group of White Mantle will spawn, which can also be skipped or killed.\nPlayers will need to run though a minimum of three Thicket Waters in order to clear the tunnel.\nThe group will then need to climb the nearby cliff and glide over to the Bouncing Mushroom, that they will use to get onto the tower.\n\nEscort Group\nThe escort group will continue forward on the ground, bringing Glenna along with them.\nWhile walking through, players will encounter mines. These mines are surrounded by a red outline, followed by a white outline. If a player steps into the the red outline, it will detonate, instantly killing them. The mine will be untargetable and immune to damage until a player steps into the white outline, revealing the mine. Players who do this must try to avoid stepping into the red outline. Glenna will also be instantly killed if she steps into the red outline. Players should also be careful to not get  feared or  kicked into the mines. The mines will respawn shortly after they are destroyed, creating a red circle on the ground and slowly growing outwards. If Glenna was unfortunately placed on a respawning mine, and players fail to notice, it will instantly detonate.\nWhile progressing through the stronghold, waves of White Mantle soldiers will march towards the group. They should be dispatched quickly so that the group may advance.\nEventually, the group will come across an area being bombarded by the tower above, making it impossible to continue forward. This will be taken care of by the tower group.\n\nSecuring a tower\nAtop the tower will be multiple White Mantle soldiers, encircled within a red ring. Once the number of players within the circle outweighs the number of White Mantle soldiers, the ring will turn green and start being captured. There is no visible progress bar when this happens. The fewer soldiers there are within the ring, the faster it will capture. Players may either kill the soldiers or use  Pulls or  Knockbacks to move them out of the ring. Once the tower is captured, it will cease firing, allowing the escort team to continue moving forward. When all White Mantle soldiers are killed, a new wave will spawn shortly after in an attempt to regain control of the tower. It is recommended to keep at least one alive to prevent this from happening.\nOnce the tower is captured, multiple things will happen. Players with the Forsaken Magic mastery may interact with the tower, allowing them to rain shards on incoming White Mantle soldiers for the escort team or at point-blank range on to undefeated enemies on the tower. Additionally, a ley line will spawn below, allowing players on the tower team to go down and help the escort team and then go back up, or vice versa. Additionally, a Warg Bloodhound will spawn at both the top of the stronghold and the entrance (colloquially called the front and back wargs respectively).\n\nWarg Bloodhounds\nThese Wargs will have a special icon on the map and will slowly move directly towards Glenna, ignoring all players. If they reach her, they will deal heavy damage, enough to kill her in one or two hits. They are immune to hard Crowd Control effects, but vulnerable to soft effects such as  Chilled,  Immobile,  Crippled. It is recommended to move Glenna away if a warg gets near.\nA common strategy is to have a player or two to deal with the warg that spawns behind the group. Players in this group should take care in avoiding the recently respawned mines while chasing down the warg. Depending on how quickly the main group advances, their job can be as simple as killing the warg as it spawns or slowing down multiple wargs. Once the four back wargs have been dealt with, they may rejoin the main group.\nThe escort team should continue moving forward until either the front or back warg gets close or they reach another impassable area due to the tower above. This time, there will be a white circle on the ground in front of this area, where players must bring Glenna so that she may create another ley line, allowing the tower team to move up to the next tower.\nThe entire siege comprises of 5 towers to be captured. Once the fifth tower is captured, McLeod the Silent will spawn and the final phase will start.\n\nMcLeod the Silent\nAfter the last tower is captured, McLeod the Silent will spawn. It is recommended for all players on the tower to jump down and rejoin with the escort team for this fight. One of his core mechanics is to teleport to the furthest player, as such it is not uncommon for him to teleport to the top of the last captured tower if players did not jump off in time. If this happens, players should continue their return to the rest of their squad, and simply wait for him to teleport once again. Alternatively, players may stay on the tower and do some damage before returning to the group.\nDuring this phase, Glenna's  Surveilled stacks will not go down, so it is not necessary to stay near her for this fight. Players will also lose their   Over Here! until after McLeod is killed.\nThere are three main mechanics players need to be aware of while fighting McLeod. His main attack resembles the mesmer's   Blurred Frenzy and will apply a very high amount of confusion to players.\nWhen he reaches 75%, 50%, and 25% health he will disappear and summon two clones with the same attacks. Each clone will have either Crimson Attunement or  Radiant Attunement. All players will be randomly given these attunements as well. The clones can only be damaged by players with the same attunement. The attunement of each character is additionally indicated by an colored overhead icon both of which can be seen in the gallery below.\nThe moment both clones are defeated, McLeod will return to the battlefield. as well as summon a Warg Bloodhound at the nearby gate. This warg will behave identical to those fought during the escort and must be dealt with swiftly before it reaches Glenna. If Glenna dies or all players are defeated, the entire encounter will have to be redone.\nOnce McLeod is defeated, players are free to bring Glenna to the gate for her to blow it open with her explosives. Once the door is blown open, the encounter is completed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Keep Construct ===\nHealth: 55,053,600\nEnrage Timer: 10 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged — Increases damage dealt by 200%.\n\n\n==== Keep Construct (Boss) ====\nThe Keep Construct will aggro on the player with the highest amount of toughness. It has an extremely large amount of health, so dealing damage to it, while not completely pointless, will be largely ineffective. In order to do more damage, the two stacks of  Xera's Embrace must be removed first.\n\nBoss Mechanics\n Gaining Power - Every minute, the Keep Construct will gain a stack, which increases the damage all its attacks will do.\n Xera's Embrace - When a projection is killed, it will create a large green circle for a second. If the Keep Construct is standing within that circle, it will remove one stack of  Xera's Embrace.\nTower Drop - The Keep Construct will create a tether between itself and the nearest player, then leap into the air, landing a few seconds later and  knocking down all nearby players.\nPhantasmal Blades (below 75%) - The Keep Construct will sit down and create a small portal-like circle at its base. It will then alternate slamming its arms down on the ground and creating a blade that slowly revolves around it.\nPlayers standing in the portal or hit by the blades will gain  Confusion (faster if they are in the portal). There are small gaps in between each blade where players may stand and safely deal damage.\nThis attack will gain an additional blade every 25% health the Keep Construct loses, capping at three blades.\nHail of Fury (below 33%) - The Keep Construct will leap into the air, becoming untargetable, and drop debris on the arena,  Stunning players that get hit.\nEven though it cannot be targeted,  Xera's Embrace can still be removed by killing projections on top of where it was before it leapt away.\n\n\n==== Mesmer Projections ====\n\nHealth: 378,576\n8 of the statues that ring the arena walls will light up, shatter and spawn projections over the course of the fight; at most one statue from either the east or west sides will spawn at a time and it will re-form once its projection is destroyed. Each projection, upon spawning, will immediately fixate on a player and begin walking towards them.\n\nEach projection will have a large white circle around them; if a projection enters the circle of another, they will both stop whatever they were doing and start slowly walking towards each other. When they meet, they will merge and form an Insidious Projection.\nWhen a projection is destroyed, it will spawn a green circle (around half the radius of the white circle). This green circle will will remove a stack of  Xera's Embrace from the Keep Construct.\n\nEach statue will spawn one of eight different projections: Galleta the Persistent, Henley the Tremulous, Engul the Calculating, Jessica the Benevolent, Olson the Elder, Ianim the Architect, Faerla the Fastidious, or Caulle the Vociferous. All 8 projections share the same attacks that do minor damage.\n\nSpawn Schedule\nOne projection will spawn from each of the two sides 20 seconds into each of the 3 main phases.\nOnce a projection is destroyed, a new projection from the same side will spawn after 20 seconds.\nStatues will light up 8 seconds before they shatter and spawn their projection, giving plenty of advanced notice to get in position.\nAll projections (except insidious ones) will despawn at the start of the Magic Blast phase.\nPlayer Effects\n Fixated - Once they spawn, projections will immediately fixate on one player, indicated visually by a white tether connected to the player and by a system message received by the fixated player stating that \"You have been fixated.\"\nIf there are multiple projections then they will each choose a different player, usually either right next to the other fixated player or bisecting the stream created by the other projection.\nThe player the Keep Construct is aggroed on will not be fixated unless they are the last player alive.\nIf a fixated player goes down, the phantasm will immediately switch to another valid player.\nInsidious Projections\nHealth: 3,785,760\nInsidious Projections will do large amounts of damage and corrupt boons, turning them into conditions. The Insidious Projection has more health than normal projections, making them more difficult to kill. It will not remove a stack of  Xera's Embrace even if it is killed. Many groups will choose to reset instead of dealing with them.\n\n\n==== Phase Mechanics (Keep Construct) ====\n\nInitial Phase\nThe goal of this phase is to kill projections on top of the Keep Construct to remove stacks of  Xera's Embrace. Once both stacks are removed, the Keep Construct will gain a Defiance bar, which should be broken in order to start the Core Exposed phase.\nDuring this phase, the Keep Construct has two possible mechanics that it will choose from randomly:\n\n Xera's Fury - All players will have a large circle spawn around them, with a red circle emanating from the center. Once the circle is fully red, each player loses 20% of their maximum health for each circle they are standing in (including their own circle).\nTip: It is recommended for all players, except the tank and one of the fixated players, to spread out. This is to allow the projection to strip a stack of  Xera's Embrace if it gets killed. Players who spread out are recommended to continue attacking the projection at a range.\nRadiant/Crimson Phantasms - The Phantasm attack will spawn multiple Radiant and Crimson Phantasms around the arena. All players will be given either  Radiant Attunement or  Crimson Attunement and must kill all phantasms they are attuned to.\nIf there are any phantasms still around 15 seconds after spawning, they will explode and deal a massive amount of damage to all players.\nThe above two attacks may be interrupted by breaking the Keep Construct's Defiance Bar, if it is available, removing the need to do any of the mechanics required for it. (i.e. the phantasms will disappear and the time bomb circles will dissipate.)\n\nCore Exposed Phase\nThe Construct's Core is exposed. Deny Xera's phantasms from protecting it.\nOnce the Keep Construct's Defiance Bar is broken, it will start to rise into the air and evade all attacks for a few seconds. Shortly after, three invulnerable Xera's Phantasms will spawn, and create a green circle around them that will slowly shrink. A minimum of two players must stand in each circle, or else the Keep Construct returns to the center of the arena, invulnerable, and kills all players, forcing the fight to be reset. Players should continue standing on the circle until after the next phase starts, as leaving the circle too early may trigger the aforementioned scenario.\nDuring this phase, projections will continue to spawn. Players should avoid dragging a projection across the arena to the opposite side, as that is where the next projection will spawn, allowing them to easily merge. Players that are not on a circle should continue focusing down these projections as they spawn.\n\nLey Rifts Phase\nCollide the core with unstable ley rifts.\nIf the previous phase was completed successfully, the arena will be surrounded by a red ring and five Unstable Ley Rifts will spawn around the inner edge. The Construct Core will then spawn in the center and Retriever Projections will spawn around the arena. This phase will end prematurely if a Retriever Projection picks up the Core. The Retrievers have a Defiance Bar which may be broken to stun them for a short while. The red ring will do a moderate amount of damage to any player standing in it.\nThe Core must be brought to the unstable rifts. For each rift the core touches, the Keep Construct will gain one stack of  Compromised during the next phase, which increases the damage taken by 75%, up to a total of 375% if the Core was brought to all five rifts. The Core may be  Pushed,  Pulled, or  Launched into each of the rifts. If these effects are not available, a player may attack the core to push it a short distance. (Cooldown: 1 second) Moving the Core into the outer red ring will cause this phase to immediately end. Player pets, minions or illusions cannot push the Core, but it will be distracting for the player doing it.[verification requested] (Especially illusions because they look similar to the projections)\nThe Projections summoned by the statues will continue to spawn in this phase and should be dispatched quickly. It is recommended to bring them to the center to avoid inadvertently hitting the Core, which may knock it out of the circle. If the core gets close to the red area, it can be pulled away or a player may go into the red area, temporarily, to knock it back towards the next rift.\n\nCore Retrieved Phase\nThe Construct's core has been retrieved.\nOnce the core has been brought to all five rifts, retrieved or knocked out of the arena, the Keep Construct will return into the center of the area. During this time, the Keep Construct will be  Stunned and  knocked down. The duration depends on how many stacks of  Compromised it has. Players should try do as much damage as possible during this phase.\nIf no rifts were obtained in the previous phase or the effects of  Compromised wore off, then the Keep Construct will start attacking players shortly afterwards. The Keep Construct will have regained both stacks of  Xera's Embrace at the start of this phase, though any projections killed on top of it will have continued to remove stacks. Players will need to remove all remaining stacks of  Xera's Embrace and restart from the initial phase until the conditions for the next phase are achieved.\n\nMagic Blast\nThe Keep Construct is attracting energy to unleash Magic Blast.\nOnce the Keep Construct is brought down to 66% or 33% health, it will start channeling its Magic Blast attack and gains  Xera's Boon which will make it invulnerable for a while. Any projections still remaining will disappear and additional ones will not spawn during this phase.\nCrimson and Radiant Energy (red and white orbs) will start spawning around the edge and slowly gravitate towards the Keep Construct. Players will then gain either  Crimson Attunement or  Radiant Attunement and must intercept each orb before they reach the Keep Construct. Each orb that gets absorbed will grant the boss one stack of  Magic Blast Intensity (caps at 35 stacks), which will increase the damage the Magic Blast attack will do. Intercepting an orb of the same color will deal a small amount of damage to the player and absorb the orb. Intercepting an orb of the opposite color will also deal some damage to the player, but the orb will pass through them.\nPlayers are recommended to spread out as evenly as possible and collect as many orbs as they can. It is not required to stray too far away from the center. Since collecting orbs deal damage to the player, players should constantly heal themselves and others during this phase. The orbs can deal critical damage.\nThis phase ends after approximately 38 seconds, after which it will release its attack (unblockable), and will resume at the initial phase.\n\n\n==== General Strategy (Keep Construct) ====\nA common strategy is to bring the Keep Construct to one side of the field, under the statue that is lighting up. This allows players to immediately focus down one projection and kill it before the other gets too close. The second projection should be killed as quickly as possible because a new statue will start lighting up on the same side of the field soon after. Then the defiance bar is broken and players spread around the three green circles. Generally the fixated player and the DPS players stay together to cleave down the projections. When the Construct Core appears the designated player should push it through as many Ley Rifts as necessary, and squadmates can help to speed it up if possible. Then the boss can be damaged until he reaches 66% or 33% health, and players have to collect orbs of the same color they're assigned to.\nThese phases are repeated until the boss dies.\n\n\n=== Twisted Castle ===\n\nThe Twisted Castle encounter begins once players kill the 3 White Mantle enemies down the stairs leaving the arena from Keep Construct.\n\nMadness\nThroughout this encounter, a new effect is present on all players, called  Madness. Each player's stacks of madness will increase throughout the encounter, and will increase at a faster rate if the character (not the player's camera) is facing the central rotating pillar. Depending on the stack number, different effects will be applied:\n\nPlayers that have the Forsaken Thicket Waters mastery will have the option, upon interacting with Fountains throughout the Twisted Castle, to either \"Dip your hands into the water.\"—removing 10 stacks of madness—or \"Drink the water.\"—granting temporary madness immunity.\n\nHaunting Statues\nThroughout the Twisted Castle, players may encounter Haunting Statues, either singular or in groups. These statues have extremely high toughness and health pool; as such attempting to destroy them is not recommended. If a character (not a player's camera) faces one of these statues, it will not be able to attack or move ( Creeping Pursuit); however should no character be facing the statue, it will rush towards a random player. Any player entering the red area of effect at the statue's feet will instantly be teleported to the start of the maze.\nA common strategy for dealing with these statues is to have one person hold the statue in place while the rest of the group runs by. One of the players having ran by the statue then turns around and faces the statue in order to allow the initial squad member to join the rest of the group.\nMaking it through the maze without being caught by a statue awards the Evasive Maneuver achievement. Eligibility may be tracked via the  Eligibility: Evasive Maneuver Achievement effect.\n\nThe Maze\nIn order to proceed through the maze, players will need to navigate through multiple sectors of the maze, defeating mobs, and activating multiple pressure plates (commonly referred to as \"buttons\") to open doors. As running the entire maze in one big group would prove too slow, a common strategy is to separate some players from the main group to activate far away buttons. For ease of explanation, a map detailing the path is present on the right of this walkthrough.\nIn order to move from one platform to another, players must approach an active gate (an active gate will pulse pink and purple, similar to a mesmer portal) and hit their interact key (default binding 'F'). Going through portals will bring players to a pre-defined location, where they will either encounter a set of enemies, traps, and/or haunting statues. If there are White Mantle enemies on the platform players spawned on, they will need to be defeated in order to activate the next portal.\nOccasionally players will be exposed to fake floors. In order to not fall through these, players will need to distinguish real floor panels from fake floor panels. Contrary to the real, stable and sturdy, real floor panels, the fake floor panels have a slight distortion effect applied to them, most noticeable near their edges.\nIn order for the encounter to end, only one player needs to interact with the bell at the end of the maze. Once the bell is rung, players will be able to respawn or take the portal up to Xera's platforms where the players will begin the last encounter of wing 3.\n\nGeneral strategy\nThe most common way to approach the encounter involves certain skips that make it faster and easier to complete, in which the squad sticks together throughout the entire encounter and 1-3 players split from the main group to activate certain key buttons.\n\n\n=== Xera ===\nHealth: 22,611,300 (goes up to 25,560,600 after 50%)\nEnrage Timer: 11 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged — Increases outgoing damage\nUpon arriving at the Xera encounter, players will be faced with one of Xera's illusions, standing still on a lower platform, taunting the players. Once players destroy this very low-health clone, the Xera fight will begin. It is therefore recommended to only destroy the clone once everyone is ready to start the encounter.\nNote that players can walk anywhere on the same platform as the clone with no effect on its status whatsoever.\nInitial Puzzle and Platform Phase\nOnce the initial Xera clone is destroyed, ley-lines will appear on both the eastern and western sides of the platform. As the group is expected to clear both sides at roughly the same time, the squad should split themselves up accordingly. Each platform holds a Bloodstone Fragment in the middle of the platform, protected by a dome; both of these must be destroyed to continue.\nThe first platform puzzle is very similar to the Core Phase in the Keep Construct encounter. Each platform will have three Exquisite Conjunctions, three Unstable Rifts, and 3 un-named orange areas of effects moving around the platform. In order to remove the protective dome from the shard, each Conjunction must be pushed through an Unstable Rift. Pushing a Conjunction through one of the orange AOEs, or pushing them off the edge of the platform, will cause the loss of said Conjunction, and players will need to wait for it to respawn. Once all Unstable Rifts destroyed, players are free to destroy the Bloodstone Fragment. With it destroyed, a ley line will appear, heading southward towards the next platform.\nThe second platform puzzle consists of three pressure pads and a protected Bloodstone Fragment. If all three pressure plates are stood on at the same time, the protective dome around the shard will be removed, allowing for it to be attacked. Standing on each pad will give a unique effect to each player standing atop it. Regardless of the pad, once the stack is about to reach 11, it will do damage equal to 100% of the player's health. Full health with barrier will be able to stay alive after 10 stacks. The stacks then start over again. As it is rather unlikely that players will be able to destroy the shard in one burn, all 3 players should hop onto their pressure plates at the same time, and on the count of 9 stacks, rotate to one of the other pressure plates. This should be repeated until the shard is destroyed. Each pressure plate's effect is unique so it is safe to rotate in this way. \nIt should as well be noted that after about 30 seconds from the start of the fight, the first platform will become ensnared in Xera's Ribbons, and after about 60 seconds so will the second. Standing on a platform ensnared in ribbons will yield very high damage onto the players.\nWith the second platform cleared, a ley line will once again appear, allowing both groups in the squad to gather on the southernmost platform. A few moments later, players will be prompted to glide to a newly-appeared central platform where Xera is present in her human form.\nHuman Phase\nThroughout this phase, the player squad will be fighting Xera in her human form, along with occasionally-spawning White Mantle soldiers, and her floating illusions. With regard to the base attacks of Xera herself, the only attack which players need to be wary of is an attack identical to that of McLeod the Silent, which resembles   Blurred Frenzy and stacks a very high amount of  Confusion.\nThroughout this phase, Bloodstone Fragments will spawn in each of the 12 segments in a clockwise order. Each fragment will have a very wide AoE around it, increasing the stacks of  Derangement of each players standing within it. While Xera stands inside a bloodstone fragment AoE she will constantly convert conditions into boons, greatly empowering her attacks and reducing damage taken. One of the tactics is to destroy these fragments as they spawn and have the player with the highest toughness (aka tank) chase after the forming fragments, making sure to stay out of their area of effect. Standing inside their AoE while they are destroyed removes 8 stacks of  Derangement if the player has the Forsaken Magic Mastery. The tactic has evolved, and nowadays the tank just has to move to bring Xera to specific positions, ignoring the fragments to maximise the DPS. As for this first human phase, the fragments can be largely ignored unless the group has very low DPS.\nXera will regularly have an active breakbar. While she is in breakbar phase she will randomly send out attacks around her (similar to Vale Guardian) and take greatly reduced damage. The longer she stays with an active breakbar, the faster the next set of Bloodstone Fragments will spawn. Breaking her bar quickly is therefore extremely important.\n\nIn addition to the Bloodstone Fragments spawning around the arena, there are three other main mechanics players need to be aware of. The first is a purple beam of light landing in the exact center of the arena, shooting out projectiles. Being hit by a projectile creates a small lifting AoE below the player that generates  Derangement stacks.\nThere is also an attack behaving similarly to the lift mechanic of the Mesmer's Elite skill Gravity Well, in which Xera will cover half of the platform in a red blurry area, every 30 seconds after Xera spawns on the main platform. Players remaining inside will be lifted after a few seconds, taking heavy damage and gaining 25 stacks of  Derangement. Patterns may be skipped if they occur at the same time as the special action key attack (see below).\nOccasionally the squad will be prompted with a message saying \"<Squad Member> has harnessed ambient magic\". The named squad member will receive a special action skill   Intervention, which they can cast as a ground targeted area of effect skill. All players must stand within the bubble to receive  Intervention as Xera's powerful attack hits the platform. Any players caught outside the bubble will be immediately defeated. If this is active while a half platform AoE would happen, that AoE is skipped.\nOnce Xera reaches 50% health, she will vanish and players will be prompted to ley line glide to the southern-most platform to continue on to the next phase. Players failing to ley glide to the next platform will fall to their death.\nSecond Platform Phase\nFor this phase, players will need to destroy a Bloodstone Fragment on every platform surrounding the main central platform. After a Bloodstone Fragment is destroyed, a ley line will appear between the current and next platforms, allowing players to rotate across all six platforms.\nAt the start of this phase, each platform, with the exception of the southern-most platform, will be modified randomly into one of many configurations. Although most platform configurations provide no real threat to players, squad members should beware of the occasional configuration in which the ley line ends right in the middle of a wall. If such a situation occurs, players will need to glide either to the left or right to an opening in the wall.\nAs soon as a player steps on a platform, AOEs will begin appearing on the ground. Although they do not deal significant damage, they do, over time, apply a significant amount of conditions. Additionally, these attacks have the option to daze a player -- an effect which is deadly to a player jumping off of an edge and hoping to glide. As such, it is important for players to be mindful of these attacks prior to them jumping off of the platform, and to be ready to re-deploy their glider should it be forcefully closed due to a daze effect.\nPlayers who fail to glide from the 5th to the 6th platform may attempt to glide to the not-yet-manifested middle, as being inside the main platform when it manifests will place the player in the middle of the platform.\nOnce all six Bloodstone Fragments destroyed, players will be prompted to once again glide to the central platform in order to continue their fight with Xera.\nHuman Phase + Second Puzzle Phase\n\nThis second phase will behave almost identically to the first human phase in terms of mechanics. The only two noticeable changes in mechanics are that the Bloodstone Fragments now spawn in a counterclockwise order, and that the platform-covering attack will have a new pattern as shown in the image on the right. The cooldown of this attack is shortened to 25 seconds.\nAt 40% Health, the squad will be prompted with the message \"Xera is teleporting squad members to a floating tower\". A few seconds later, 5 random squad members (excluding the player with the highest toughness) will be teleported to a platform. They will there have 2 minutes [verification requested] to complete the same core-pushing puzzle as at the start of the fight. Naturally, the puzzle has to be completed as soon as possible; otherwise, the remaining players on the main platform will be cleaved down by overwhelming soldiers and illusions. Additionally, there is a portal available which can be used by only one player to return to the main platform immediately. Usually the main healer will go back to the platform if all healers got teleported. The rest of the players will be returned to the main platform shortly after they complete the puzzle.\nAt 20% health, Xera will once again teleport players to another platform where they will need to complete the pressure-plate puzzle. Players returning from both puzzles will have the  Hero's Return effect, which will shield them from damage they might take from spawning back on the main platform. However, they can still be hit by the projectiles emitted from the purple beam, so make sure to avoid them.\nOnce Xera is defeated, players will be lifted and dropped down into the Temple of Awakening where players can find Xera's Chest and information on the White Mantle activities.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAnimals\nRabbit\nAsura\nScholar Glenna\nInsect\nBeetle\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nConstructs\nConstruct Core\nHaunting Statue\nKeep Construct (boss)\nFungi\nElite Mushroom King\nVeteran Mushroom Spike Thrower\nVeteran Mushroom Stomper\nPhantasms\nCaulle the Vociferous\nCrimson Phantasm\nEngul the Calculating\nFaerla the Fastidious\nGalleta the Persistent\nHenley the Tremulous\nIanim the Architect\nInsidious Projection\nJessica the Benevolent\nOlson the Elder\nRadiant Phantasm\nRetriever Projection\nXera's Phantasm\nWhite Mantle\nMcLeod the Silent (boss)\nWhite Mantle Battle Mage\nWhite Mantle Cleric\nWhite Mantle Cultist\nWhite Mantle Knight\nWhite Mantle Seeker\nXera (boss)\n\n\n== Objects ==\nAnvil\nBouncing Mushrooms\nCauldron\nCorpse\nDecorative Armor\nDrawbridge Lever\nFountain\nHammer\nLey Rift\nPainting\nThicket Waters\n\n\n=== Books and Journals ===\nBulletin\nCaptain's Log\nGlenna's Field Journal\nJournal\nNote\nShipping Manifest\nThe Awakening\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\nConfessor Dorian\nConfessor Isaiah\nSaul D'Alessio\nTenad the Faithful\n\n\n=== Inside the Temple of Awakening ===\nBarrel\nBookshelf\nMursaat Bust\nSpent Shards\nStasis Chamber\n\n\n=== Chests ===\nBoss chests\nSiege Chest\nKeep Construct Chest\nXera's Chest\nHidden chests\nHidden chest\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\nEntering Stronghold of the Faithful:\n\n<Character name>: We got your message.

We're going through the gate.\nTaimi: I've configured it to appear as if we're going to the Command Center, but we're really going to you-know-where.\nTaimi: Except...there's a catch. You have to outsmart the security measures.\n<Character name>: You're joking, right?\nTaimi: Not this time. Give it a shot, and I'll observe. See if you can crack the code.\nTaimi: I'll give you a hint. Do exactly as you're told.\nInteracting with the console the first time:\n\nIf asura:\nGate Console: Taimi's mark is all over this console. She's hidden secret applications and... Wow! This is ingenious. She's conquered the problem of gates going to only one destination. Security, however, is strict.\nOtherwise:\nGate Console: The console appears old, but it has obviously cleaned up.\n Attempt to solve the puzzle.\n Skip the puzzle.\nConsole: Unidentified—user. Security—measures—activated.\nConsole: Enter—passcode.\nInteracting with the console after failing:\n\nGate Console: Try again?\n Attempt to solve the puzzle.\n Skip the puzzle.\nSuccessful chain:\n\nConsole: Phase—one—of—five—complete.

Passcode—accepted. Gate—relay—Zero-4-6-8-7—activated.\nTaimi: That's our cue. You cracked the code. Let's go.\nFailing the Novus console minigame (a nearby reseracher will get hit by lightning bolts):\n\nConsole: Interact—with—the—console—only—if—you—are—an—approved—user.\nResearcher (1): Must be love.\nResearcher (2): More like marriage. Ow.\nConsole: Incorrect.\nResearcher (1): Y-y-yikes! What's causing that?\nResearcher (2): This place is an accident waiting to happen.\nConsole: Incorrect.\nResearcher (1): Z-z-ztttt.

Easy there, fellas.\nResearcher: I am not amused.\nResearcher: Shut up.\nTaimi: That's our cue. You didn't crack the code, so I did it for you while you were busy. We shouldn't dillydally any longer. Let's go.\nThe Dragon Room\nInside Dragon room:\n\nTaimi: Sorry to put you through that.\nTaimi: I need to keep people who may or may not be named Phlunt outta here.\nRytlock Brimstone: Now that the subterfuge is out of the way, can we get to what you called us here for?\nTaimi: Yes! This is a replica of the ley-line energy map we found outside of Tarir.\nTaimi: I've been tracking the movement of magic since Mordremoth's death.\nTaimi: It's been in total chaotic flux; here, there, everywhere!\nTaimi: See, that dot is the egg chamber. It lit up like a Lunar New Year firework after the dragon went bye-bye.\nTaimi: But as you can see here...\nTaimi: The egg's doing great!\n<Character name>: What are we looking at? A feed of the egg chamber?\nTaimi: Yeah, the Exalted and the Rata Novans shared a ton of information.\nTaimi: They must have helped them design their security system.\n<Character name>: And then you broke into it?\nTaimi: No. I utilized it to check on the egg.\nRytlock Brimstone: So you broke into it.\nTaimi: Hey, we're all friends, right? I don't think they'd mind.\nTaimi: Just... Maybe just don't mention it around any floaty gold people.\n<Character name>: Do you have access to surveillance all over Tarir?\nTaimi: Back to the ley-line map!\nTaimi: So this other point is...huh. That's new. The northern Bloodstone dot is flaring up. I'll have to keep an eye on that.\n<Character name>: The spot where Mordremoth died looks like it's cooling down a little.\nTaimi: Yeah, a lot of that energy has been put back into the system...\nTaimi: I'm trying to model its patterns, but this map isn't built for detailed readings...yet. In the meantime, look at this!\nAt the specimen tube:\n\n<Character name>: What is it?\nTaimi: Not to toot my own warbler or anything, but I killed a chak or two in my time alone here.\nTaimi: Since the others don't know about this place, I couldn't ask to have defenses installed...\nTaimi: So, they pop up every once in a while when the lab's drawing a lot of power.\nRytlock Brimstone: Like those?\nTaimi: Exactly! Get them!\nRytlock Brimstone: Aargh! That sound makes my teeth ache!\nWhile fighting the waves of chak:\n\nRytlock Brimstone: Taimi, you gotta stop eating cookies in your lab.\nTaimi: I think they smell the organ I harvested. Might be one of their kin.\nRytlock Brimstone: More incoming—it ain't naptime yet!\nTaimi: Way to exterminate! Don't worry about their goo. I'll clean that up later.\nBack to the specimen tube:\n\nTaimi: Anyway, this thing is some sort of organ I found in one of the larger ones.\nTaimi: It's part of their digestive system, and as you know, they feed on ley energy, so it got me curious.\n<Character name>: Any valuable findings yet?\nTaimi: None I can explain right now. I ran some ley energy through it and it came out different on the other side.\n<Character name>: Different?\nTaimi: I'm not really sure how just yet. It was barely measurable with the equipment I have.\nTaimi: I need to develop some other device to actually observe the phenomenon.\n<Character name>: What's that sludge you're keeping it in?\nTaimi: Blighting pod fluid! Remember that stuff? It has wonderful preservative, and even restorative, properties!\n<Character name>: Fluid. From the blighting pods. The things that made horrible Mordrem abominations out of corpses.\nTaimi: So you do remember it!\n<Character name>: Taimi... Do you think, maybe, that might be a bad idea?\nTaimi: Oh, you worry too much! In research, there's no reward without risk!\nTaimi: And if I'm going to stay one step ahead of everyone outside this lab, I have to take a lot of risks!\nTaimi: But one thing I can't risk is staying away from the main lab too long—it arouses suspicion. Let's go.\nRytlock Brimstone: I got your back. You first.\nOptional\nInteracting with the device upstairs:\n\nUnknown: Eavesdropping—device—activated. Touch—each—time—you—want—to—hear—a—short—snippet—from—the—other—room.\n Eavesdrop on a line with each touch of the console.\nEavesdropping the other room (it is not clear how many different researchers are talking):\n\nKrewemaster (1): Don't worry about Taimi beating us to it. Phlunt assures me he has her under his thumb.\nKrewemaster (2): From what I hear, Taimi has an advantage. I'd excel if I had Zojja as a mentor too.\nWindall: Did you see where Taimi and that odd krewe of hers went?\nResearcher (1): The humans are all abuzz about some group called the White Mantle. They're so shortsighted.\nResearcher (2): I didn't capture it all, but I got some of the data in their krewe notes.\nResearcher (3): There's another charr here. That's multiple in one day. How odd.\nResearcher (4): I'm going to sneak a look at Taimi's equipment. Watch my back.\nResearcher (5): Poor kid. Stuck out here without her golem. I don't know how she does it.\nResearcher (6): Taimi? Yes, cute as a bug. If my son were here, I'd introduce them. Imagine the progeny.\nWindall: Is that the leader of the Vigil? Oh my. She's quite impressive.\nResearcher (7): (laugh) Don't tell him, but I secretly call him Blunt because he is. Taimi got a raw deal on that waypoint device.\nResearcher (8): I heard Zojja's scrambled. Drooling. Explains why Taimi's out here on her own.\nUnknown: Recorder—has—reached—maximum—capacity. Touch—the—console—each—time—you—want—to—hear—another—previously—recorded—snippet.\n Play a recorded snippet with each touch on the console.\nMore Meetings\nBack through the portal:\n\nPeacemaker Guard: Stand down. It's just Taimi's friends again.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: I was told I'd find the Pact commander here. Anyone? Were they wrong?\nTalking to Almorra Soulkeeper:\n\n<Character name>: General Soulkeeper, this is quite a surprise. What brings you to Rata Novus?\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: You do, Commander. I've come here to offer you a new position within the Pact.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: The Marshal rank is...uh...vacant. And we want you to fill it.\n<Character name>: This is an honor.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: I'm glad you view it in that light. The Pact is hanging on by a thread.\n<Character name>: I see...\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: I can tell you're having your doubts, so let me just be up front about the role.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: Certain Pact elements feel like Marshal Trahearne's mistake was going out into the field and getting himself killed.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: The new marshal would be planted safely in an office in Lion's Arch. Still leading the troops, but out of harm's way.\n<Character name>: As flattered as I am by your offer, I'm going to have to respectfully decline, General.\n<Character name>: After our Mordremoth battle, I believe I, Rytlock, and the others would be more effective operating as our own guild.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: I understand the decision on your early retirement, although I'm disappointed. I still believe in the Pact's goal.\n<Character name>: I do too, and I'll always be ready to lend a hand. It'll just be outside the system.\nRytlock Brimstone: Out from under a mountain of paperwork, you mean!\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: Laugh it up, no-eyes. I have something for you too.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: A letter from the Black Citadel. You must've really brushed some higher-ups the wrong way.\n<Character name>: Are you sure you want to just crumple that up and throw it away?\nRytlock Brimstone: Why not? It's what I did with the last two.\nTaimi: What did I hear? You're not in the Pact anymore? Wait. What do I call you? Pooh-bah?\n<Character name>: Uh, no. How about we just stick with commander for now?\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: Technically, it's a title for life, so you're welcome to it.\nPeacemaker Guard: What was that?\nPeacemaker Guard: That didn't sound good.\nPeacemaker Guard: Quick! Let's go see what's happening!\nGuide: Protect the councillors!\nResearcher: (scream) Run! It's a crazy sylvari!\nTechnician: Please...get the dragon man away from me.\nCouncillor Phlunt: Taimi! Is that another of your friends?\n<Character name>: What happened?\nCanach: I came in through the caves because I couldn't find the gate. I wasn't expecting such an...enthusiastic welcome.\nTaimi: Did you see that? Phlunt was so mad, even his fleas jumped ship. Canach, you're my hero.\n<Character name>: Why the surprise visit?\nCanach: I'm here answering the call...\n<Character name>: But Mordremoth's dead! We killed—\nCanach: Oh, it's not the jungle dragon's call. This time it's Anise's.\n<Character name>: Still holds your billet, eh?\nCanach: She does.\nCanach: But certain messy events have transpired, and I'm assured that if I clean them up...\nCanach: My billet will be released, and I'll once again be free from any yoke.\n<Character name>: How can I help?\nCanach: Minister Caudecus recently, ahem, \"left\" the queen's protective custody.\nCanach: Anise sent me and a squad of Shining Blade to help the good minister find his way back to Divinity's Reach.\n<Character name>: Any idea on his whereabouts?\nCanach: There's been a flare-up of White Mantle activity in northern Maguuma, and intel points to him possibly heading there.\nTaimi: That's the crazy magical hot spot we saw! Up by the Bloodstone!\nRytlock Brimstone: I thought the minister claimed to not be in bed with those mursaat lovers.\nCanach: Didn't we all?\n<Character name>: Rytlock, get word to the others.\n<Character name>: Marjory might be getting a little restless in Divinity's Reach and want in on the action.\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: Commander, if you'd like, you can hitch a ride on my airship. It's on our way; we can drop you off.\n<Character name>: Now that's an offer I can't turn down, General.\nCanach: Perfect. I'll grab my Shining Blade detachment and meet you there.\nSpeaking with Canach:\n\nCanach: What a day, huh? It's almost enough to make a person feel unwelcome.\n Yeah. Before I go, tell me what you know about the White Mantle.\n(if human)\nThe throne in Divinity's Reach has her royal pantaloons in a bunch. Your people's history with the White Mantle is wrecking nerves. It's not been pretty to watch. Anise has her hatchet face on.\n I slept through history class. Can I ask you some questions? (Same as below)\n(if not human)\nThe queen in Divinity's Reach has her royal pantaloons in a bunch. Humans have a history with the White Mantle, you know? It's not been pretty to watch. Anise has her hatchet face on.\n I slept through Human History class. Can I ask you some questions?\nYou can ask. I'll tell you what I know—what I do know is pretty juicy.\n What's the White Mantle's background?\nThey used to rule Kryta, long ago. They worshipped ancient beings called the mursaat who were powerful magic users. The White Mantle were their pawns.\n Tell me more about the mursaat.\nLong-lived, magical, mean to the bone...and extinct. Krytans wiped them out, won the war, and took back their kingdom under Queen Salma's leadership. I've heard they're trying to resurrect one.\n Resurrect? What?\nThey're insane. My intel tells me they're in northern Maguuma, running experiments with a bloodstone. I know their type. They want power, and they'll do whatever it takes to get it.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n The White Mantle lost the war. Where've they been for two hundred years?\nUnderground? Somewhere well hidden, since everyone seems surprised to see them. My guess is they've been hiding in plain sight, waiting for their moment. They've got gold behind them, though.\n Does the countess know who's funding them?\nNo, but those ruins around Dry Top weren't so fancy, so I'm guessing it isn't from their own treasury.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n Why are the White Mantle suddenly so active?\nI have a theory. If they've been biding their time and rebuilding their numbers and influence, then it'd be smart to attack when their enemy is engaged in a multifront war with dragons. Good strategy.\n Go on.\nPlus our allies—the Pact and sylvari—have been greatly weakened. And we can't discount the increase in magic. Everything I know about them indicates they're creepy magickers.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n How serious is this threat?\nTruth is, I'd be surprised if this were an empty threat. You don't wait a couple hundred years to fizzle out like a wet fuse. I'm going to guess they've got big plans that won't make Kryta happy.\n What does the crown plan to do?\nEverything within their power. My squad is off to gather information...and we're authorized to use lethal force if necessary. I expect it'll be necessary.\n So they're throwing everything they've got at this?\nThat's a fair statement. Caudecus sure picked the right moment to escape. He knows they won't waste the manpower to go after him.\n Who is Caudecus?\nHe's head of the Krytan Ministry. He's been on house arrest for minor treachery. Slipped his cushy detention recently. No one knows where he is. The timing's \"coincidental,\" if you know what I mean.\n No, what do you mean?\nHe's been undermining the Krytan throne for years. He wants the Ministry in charge. No, he wants to be in charge himself. Don't underestimate him, my friend. He's slimy.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n I have another question.\n That's enough. Thanks. I'll see you later.\n One last thing. What's happening with your billet?\nHer grace the countess has said I'll have earned it back if I'm successful on this mission. She certainly knows how to motivate me.\n I have another question.\n Time for me to go. Good luck, my friend.\n I must go. Be careful, and I'll see you soon.\nSpeaking with General Soulkeeper:\n\nGeneral Almorra Soulkeeper: Let's get underway.\nEntering Bloodstone Fen\nCinematic:\n\nFemale crewmember: Commander's destination ahead! Looks like we're in for quite a ride.\nMale crewmember: We're not flying into that scramble, are we?\nFemale crewmember: By gods, grow a backbone! Scared of a little weather?\n(Explosion begins)\nFemale crewmember: All hands, full reverse!\nFemale crewmember: On your feet. We survived...somehow.\nAdditional dialogues\nThe guide leading several councillors around:\n\nGuide: We know little about the Novans, but we're extracting more and more each day.\nGuide: Follow me, please.\nGuide: When our ancestors were leaving the caverns, a revolutionary krewe decided instead to build an underground fortress.\nGuide: This way, if you please.\nGuide: The Novus krewe dedicated much of their research to finding defenses against the Elder Dragons. Primordus especially.\nGuide: Considering it was Primordus and its destroyers that were driving our ancestors out of their homes, it's logical.\nGuide: Sadly, the story doesn't end well for the Novans. They were massacred by chak. We believe they never saw it coming.\nGuide: Councillor Phlunt and the other krewe leads here are confident they'll uncover heretofore unseen data on Primordus.\nGuide: We're collecting vast amounts of knowledge about Novan history.\nGuide: Follow me, please.\nGuide: As you can see, Councillors, this is quite a monumental find.\nGuide: Look around as you wish, Councillors. I'll wait here for you. We'll return to Rata Sum when you're ready.\nAmbient dialogues\nResearcher (1): Ever since that surge of magic, this place has been going bonky!\nResearcher (2): It's an anomaly. Novus seems to have grown more alert...very recently.\nWindall: You think it could be related to the death of the Elder Dragon?\nWindall: Deciphering...deciphering...\nKrewemaster: Come on, come on!\n\n\n== My story ==",

      "strName": "Bloodstone Fen",
      "strWikiText": "Bloodstone Fen is a zone in the Heart of Maguuma, and the location of the Maguuma Jungle Bloodstone. The White Mantle has been active here since their exile from Kryta, studying the Bloodstone's properties and how to harness its power. Years of tampering with the Bloodstone has caused it to explode, devastating the surrounding area and leaving orbs of Unbound Magic and pockets of Unstable Magic suspended in the air.\nThe majority of the White Mantle and Pact personnel who survived the explosion have been driven mad, hungering for Bloodstone magic. The souls of humans sacrificed atop the Bloodstone have been freed and haunt the area as restless spirits, most notably the dangerous Justiciar Hablion. The White Mantle have also managed to take control of jade constructs, which are periodically brought into Bloodstone Maw to gather any lingering energy.\nWhile in Bloodstone Fen, characters have access to special skills usable while gliding, channeling ambient magic to attack foes and maneuver while airborne.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nLike most of the Living World Season 3 zones, Bloodstone Fen is not directly connected to neighboring areas. In order to reach it, one can use one of the following methods:\n\nComplete the Out of the Shadows instance Research in Rata Novus - the second story step of Episode 1 from Living World Season 3.\nUse a Bloodstone Fen Portal Scroll.\nUse a Teleport to Friend after having unlocked the Out of the Shadows episode on the account.\nNot having unlocked the story episode will result in a wasted Teleport to Friend.\n(If your friend is actually standing on the waypoint, you will get the waypoint, but you will still not have access to the map until starting the episode.)\n\n\n== Map resources ==\n  Unbound Magic is found throughout the map and is dropped by various enemies and events.\n  Blood Rubies can be found in Bloodstone Crystal ore nodes throughout the map and as event rewards. These are needed to buy Blood Ruby accessories from Scholar Rakka.\n\n\n== Gliding skills ==\nInitially, characters can only use Focused Magic. To unlock the other skills, they must be purchased from Natto aboard the Pride of the Pact airship. The purchase is for all characters and is only required once per account.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\nSky\n\nGround\n\nDepths\n\n\n== Events ==\nFragmented Wastes\nThis is a continuous series of events on the shattered top layer of Bloodstone Fen. Rifts open and expunge disorientated creatures that must be beaten down to force them back into the rift. When enough creatures have been defeated, the rift closes and the event succeeds. The rifts can be reached from the air, or via Rift Entrances that spawn in the Haunted Canyons and Bloodstone Maw areas.\nOnce eight of these rifts are closed, a group boss event will spawn at Bloodstone's Shell.\n\n  Defeat beasts disgorged from the blazing unstable rift (80)\n  Defeat beasts disgorged from the frigid unstable rift (80)\n  Defeat beasts disgorged from the rumbling unstable rift (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the enormous bloodstone elemental!

Once completed, four Champion ghosts will spawn after one another and finally an escort event with Alari Doubleblade as she makes her way to Tomb of the Confessors.\n\n  Exorcise the angered spirits stalking the Haunted Canyons (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the angry spirit of Savant Ehrin (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the angry spirit of Nyle the Compassionate (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the angry spirit of Ritualist Josa (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the angry spirit of Thief Lloyd (80)\n [Group Event] Escort Alari Doubleblade on her quest for vengeance (80)\nBloodstone Maw\nThe meta event appears on a 60 minute cooldown, the timer appears to be instance-based rather than set on a global timer. The 60 minute countdown starts when the Unbound Guardian dies or an event in the event chain fails. After the countdown, the Jade Construct events will recommence. The first event of the chain starts at the  Ground Zero Waypoint — . A Champion Jade Armor or a Champion Jade Bow must be defeated before it absorbs the Bloodstone Stalagmite (which can be communed with for experience and 10 Unbound Magic once the Jade Construct is dead). Once the first event has been completed, a new one will appear at the lower level, followed by two more of the same format. The final event of this type features both the Armor and the Bow bosses.\nAfter all of the Jade bosses have been defeated, a Legendary Unbound Guardian appears deep within the Cavern of Unseen Lights. A time limit of 15 minutes is in place to defeat it.\n\n [Group Event] Defeat the jade construct before it drains the bloodstone! (80) (occurs four times in different locations)\n [Group Event] Defeat the jade constructs before they drain the bloodstone! (80)\n [Group Event] Disperse the Unbound Guardian (80)\nOther events\n  Kill the seekers to halt the cleric's supply of bloodstone shards, or throw shards at her to weaken her shield (80)\n  Kill the White Mantle cleric! (80)\n  Kill the empowered White Mantle cleric! (80)\n [Group Event] Find and slay the treasure mushroom! (80)\n  Stop the skritt burglar before she escapes with the treasure (80)\nColosseum of the Faithful\n\n  Exorcise the angered spirits haunting Zealot's Overlook (80)\n [Group Event] Defeat the spirit of Justiciar Hablion (80) (This chain is on a similar timer to Unbound Guardian. It resets 30 minutes after Justiciar Hablion is defeated.)\n\n\n== Related achievements ==\n\n\n== Crafting resources ==\nResource nodes\n Mithril Ore/Rich Mithril Vein\n Orichalcum Ore\n Bloodstone Crystals\n Palm Sapling\n Ancient Sapling\n Jungle Plants\n Sawgill Mushrooms\n Flax\n Mussels\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nDuring the events of Guild Wars, the White Mantle would use this location to sacrifice villagers at the behest of the mursaat in order to power the soul batteries keeping shut the Door of Komalie.",

Once the sixth and final fragment has been collected, another White Mantle ambush will occur. Once these White Mantle are defeated, use the updrafts or bouncing mushrooms to reach the central platform again and witness a cinematic.\nAfter the cinematic, glide down to talk to the Shining Blade Paratrooper and complete the mission.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nComplete the instance.\n\nThis can be done on the first play through, and is awarded once the instance is complete. The objects begin to fall as soon as you are directed to collect the bloodstone samples. Simply avoid being hit by any falling objects, which may be easier to accomplish by staying airborne as much as possible. The falling objects are indicated by large red circles on the floor with an expanding inner red circle. Once it fully expands the shards fall to the ground.\nWhile these circles seem to only spawn where you're on the edge of them, it's best to bring along utilities or weapons that allow you to leap or blink away in case you end up in the middle of one of these circles.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that they continue to spawn throughout the instance even after you've collected the bloodstone samples and test them out with Caithe, so watch out for them when you go down to speak with the Shining Blade agent at the end of the instance, as they can still spawn on you.\nAlternatively, you can glide on to a ledge on the walls on either side of the map every time a new wave of white mantle arrive and use an engineer's Elite Mortar Kit to defeat them. This prevents bloodstone shards from hitting you and also allows you to defeat enemies simultaneously.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Qualify for The Sky Is Falling effect.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nTaimi (voice only)\nHumans\nShining Blade Paratrooper\nSquad Leader Bennett (In open world)\nSylvari\nCaithe\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nConstruct\nLey-Infused Weapons\nElementals\nBloodstone Elemental Mauler\nVeteran Anomaly\nJade Constructs\nVeteran Jade Armor\nHumans\nWhite Mantle Battle Mage\nWhite Mantle Cleric\nWhite Mantle Elementalist\nWhite Mantle Inquisitor\nWhite Mantle Knight\nWhite Mantle Mesmer\nWhite Mantle Scout\nWhite Mantle Seeker\n\n\n== Objects ==\nBouncing Mushroom\nEmpowered Bloodstone Shard\nPedestal\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\n\n=== Open World ===\nSpeaking with Squad Leader Bennett:\n\n<Character name>: Bennett, any update on the creature that hospitalized your scout?\nSquad Leader Bennett: We finally got a message from Priory headquarters. Hard to get a pigeon to fly through a magical storm in one piece.\nSquad Leader Bennett: The description of these \"stone men\" matched an ancient weapon the mursaat and White Mantle used before the Krytan Civil War.\nSquad Leader Bennett: They're called jade constructs, and they were the mursaat's primary martial units.\n<Character name>: Floating constructs? That sounds similar to the Exalted.\nTaimi: That's because they're using ancient magic from a similar origin, or at least that's my current theory, Pooh-bah.\nSquad Leader Bennett: Did...your backpack just call you \"pooh-bah,\" Commander?\n<Character name>: It's a long story. Go on, Taimi.\nTaimi: There was a time, way back, when the Seers and the mursaat shared a lot of info. Why do you think they're all so...floaty?\n<Character name>: So is there anything that'll keep me alive in a fight against these jade things?\nTaimi: Remember that magical protection I told you about? That should work against jade constructs, too.\nTaimi: It was based on Seer research that Zinn, the founder of Rata Novus, performed during the Krytan Civil War.\nTaimi: I highly suggest mastering it before you get in a smashy scenario with one of those jade brutes. Good luck! Taimi out!\n\n\n=== In the instance ===\nEntering the cavern:\n\n<Character name>: It looks like there are magical scorch marks leading this way.\nAt the temple:\n\n<Character name>: Who's there?\nCaithe: It's me, Commander.\n<Character name>: Caithe! Bennett said he saw you.\nCaithe: Are you...?\n<Character name>: Trying to figure out why the explosion reversed itself and the trail led me here. Look at these marks.\n<Character name>: Could these have been made by a torrent of magic?\nCaithe: Possibly. You think something or someone was behind this? Or was it a natural disaster?\n<Character name>: Seems like an awfully odd natural disaster. You saw what happened, right?\nCaithe: I've recently learned to not always rely on my senses. They can...betray you.\n<Character name>: This pedestal seems to be the nexus of it all. Let's look around and—\nCaithe: Tremor!\n(If human, charr or sylvari)\n<Character name>: Incoming!\n(If male norn)\n<Character name>: By the Bear!\n(If female norn)\n<Character name>: Raven's beak!\n(If asura)[verification requested]\n<Character name>: By my ears!\n(If female asura)\n<Character name>: Danger incoming!\nCaithe: Did you see that?\n<Character name>: That bloodstone explosion seemed to trigger some sort of magical echo.\nCaithe: I couldn't really tell what was happening.\n<Character name>: Let's find some more bloodstone and see if we can re-create it; get a clearer picture.\n<Character name>: This could give us an insight on why the blast reversed itself.\nSearching for bloodstone pieces\nWhile making progress in searching:\n\n<Character name>: How did you end up down here?\nCaithe: I was returning from the Grove when I saw the explosion on the horizon. I wasn't going to leave it uninvestigated.\n<Character name>: Good work getting this deep into the crater; must have been moving like a shadow out there.\nCaithe: It's what I do.\n<Character name>: What was your business in the Grove?\nCaithe: I was visiting the Pale Tree.\n<Character name>: How is she after Mordremoth's death?\nCaithe: Ailing, but recovering. Although, not well enough to...give me the guidance I needed.\n<Character name>: Sorry to hear that...\nCaithe: It's... Back to the task at hand.\nCaithe: Those explosions exposed some more bloodstones.\nThe shard near the broken staircase:\n\n<Character name>: Some bloodstone pieces next to this staircase.\n<Character name>: Guess this is how someone would get down here to do...whatever it is our test hopefully reveals.\nCaithe: Hmm. I guess I really wanted it to be a natural disaster.\nCaithe: Didn't want to think about someone tinkering with so much power.\nEncountering the Bloodstone Mauler\n\n<Character name>: Caithe, over here.\nThe shard near the ley-infused weapons:\n\n<Character name>: Just a bunch of weapons.\nCaithe: You sure about that? Because they're glowing...\nAfter defeating the ley-infused weapons:\n\n<Character name>: That was unexpected.\nCaithe: I'll hold my \"I told you so.\"\nShards at the remains of the camp:\n\n<Character name>: Bloodstone under this table...\nUnknown: This piece of paper seems barely touched by the destruction. It looks as if someone was taking notes during a conversation or translating a coded message.\n Read it.\n...trial #33, complete failure. Received orders to increase output. Results demanded so or...or what? Or else.\n Read on.\nThe rumbling of dissent in our ranks is unacceptable for research progress. Being pulled in two directions. I want to stay the course and not listen to this new, shady influence behind the curtain.\n Read on.\nWho is the justiciar getting his orders from anyway? My loyalty is a liability here now. Perhaps I should flee before the rift becomes inescapable.\n Read on.\nI hate to leave my White Mantle brothers and sisters, but I will not follow someone who won't reveal themselves while issuing threats so liberally.\n Stow it.\n Stow it.\n Stow it.\n Stow it.\n<Character name>: It's a note. Must have survived in this chest.\nCaithe: What's it say?\n<Character name>: It was White Mantle, all right. Apparently they've been prodding the Bloodstone for some time now.\n<Character name>: But it also hints at some sort of splintering within their group and a divisive leader. Must be Caudecus.\nCaithe: The legate minister? I should stop by Divinity's Reach more often. I'm out of the loop.\nFinal shard with the Jade Armor:\n\n<Character name>: Some more bloodstone here. Can't believe this operation was happening under our noses this whole time...\n(If human)\nOne of:\n<Character name>: This doesn't look good.\n<Character name>: By the Six... What is that?\n(If charr or sylvari)\n<Character name>: What is that?\n(If female norn) [verification requested]\n<Character name>: That's no ordinary beast.\n(If asura)\n<Character name>: This doesn't look good.\nAfter defeating the Jade Armor:\n\n<Character name>: (victory cheer)\nAfter gathering all shards:\n\n(If human, asura, female norn, female charr or sylvari) [verification requested]\n<Character name>: Ambush! Back up! Back up!\n(If male charr)\n<Character name>: Move!\nCaithe: Commander, before we go any further, I want to clear the air between us.\n<Character name>: Here...? Why would I expect any different; your timing has always been perfect...\nCaithe: See? That's why I have to speak now! I know you're still upset with me...and you have every right to be.\nCaithe: I can't take back what happened, but I can tell you I know what I did was wrong and I'm sorry.\nCaithe: My Wyld Hunt, Mordremoth's voice...they were tearing at each other and sometimes I didn't know which was which.\nCaithe: I was very confused, and I felt like the only person I could trust was me.\n<Character name>: That's the very time you should have leaned on your friends!\nCaithe: Don't you see? I didn't know who my friends were! Enemies, friends, even Faolain—it was all gray.\nCaithe: I wish I would have trusted you, but I didn't. And now that's in the past.\nCaithe: All I can do is hope you'll forgive me in the future.\n<Character name>: Caithe—\nCaithe: You don't have to respond now. I want you to think about it, so your decision is considered.\n<Character name>: Okay, well... Let's see if our little experiment works.\nBack at the temple:\n\n<Character name>: Ready? I'll take care of releasing their magic.\nCaithe: Then what?\n<Character name>: Then we cross our fingers that we jump-start the magic echo and don't blow ourselves to smithereens.\nAfter placing the bloodstones on the pedestal:\n\n<Character name>: What was that? What happened?\nCaithe: Where you were standing...there was only a brilliant light, devouring magic.\nCaithe: Then some people behind the light didn't look so lucky. These silhouettes...\n<Character name>: They must have been vaporized by the blast.\nCaithe: Who would have done this purposefully?\n<Character name>: Someone who just absorbed the lion's share of a bloodstone's worth of magic.\n<Character name>: Could have been Caudecus. I have to find Canach and warn him...if he's still alive.\nShining Blade Paratrooper: Commander! Are you up there?\nCaithe: Sounds like someone's looking for you.\nShining Blade Paratrooper waves at <Character name>.\nSpeaking to the Shining Blade Paratrooper:\n\nShining Blade Paratrooper bows to <Character name>.\nShining Blade Paratrooper: Commander, Canach ordered us to find you. Minister Caudecus is in the area.\n<Character name>: He's alive! I need to tell him about what we just witnessed. Point me in the right direction... Uh, Caithe?\nCaithe: You know what; I think I'll stay a moment. Maybe poke around some more.\n<Character name>: Are you sure? Will you be okay?\nCaithe: It's fine, Commander. Remember? I'm a shadow.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe title of \"A Shadow's Deeds\" directly refers to the atomic shadows (silhouettes) surrounding the bloodstone. In symbolism, a shadow is representative of one's former self, possibly referencing Caithe's apology for her actions in Heart of Thorns.",

      "strWikiText": "Rata Novus, referred to by asura as the lost city, is an old asuran city founded by Zinn whose inhabitants were conducting research on how to defeat the Elder Dragons—with a heavy focus on Primordus. While the Exalted were building Tarir, the Rata Novans allied with them due to their shared goal.\nThe city has natural lighting from the surface through means of optical cables that carry the sunlight. The rest of the city was powered by the energy coming straight from the ley lines, and the city itself is built atop one of the three large hubs of ley line energy in the Heart of Maguuma (the others being where Mordremoth and Tarir are located). This draw of ley energy attracted large amounts of chak, which eventually caused the downfall of the city when it was overrun with chak in 1173 AE. Only 2% of the city's population managed to evacuate, including its founder Zinn, who relocated to a colony still in development, Rata Arcanum. The last asuran occupants set the city's defense system to attack any intruders it could before they were finally overwhelmed. Without maintenance, the city's power eventually ran out and became inactive.\n\n\n== Locations and objectives ==\nWaypoints\n Rata Novus Waypoint — \nPoints of Interest\n Rata Novus Command Center — \n Rata Novus Orchards — \n Rata Novus Perimeter — \nVistas\n Rata Novus Vista — \nThe vista is accessed from the south side of the Decayed Hive.

Also while their attacks are similar to regular destroyers, they spawn pools of lava, which can be only be doused by blue spheres that spawn around the room. As long as you keep this in mind, you shouldn't have too hard of a time dealing with the waves, though at the start of the third wave, you do want to remove the Massive Destroyer Crab who can fire a line of lava pools.

Forced to mingle with the rabble.\nSpeaking to the Researcher\nWhat? Are you back to take another hack at my poor golem?\n Your golem attacked me.\nTechnicalities. You didn't have to destroy it.\n No, I really did have to.\nAfter interacting with the console\nConsole: Final—phase—complete. Passcode—accepted. Gate—relay—Zero-4-6-8-7—activated.\nUpon arriving in the lab\n<Character name>: Taimi! Please tell me there was some sort of calculations error. Primordus is really active?\nTaimi: An error? You think I made an— Hey, good to see you too.\n<Character name>: Sorry. I didn't think we'd be dealing with another dragon so soon.\nTaimi: About that... I have some good news and bad news.\n<Character name>: What's the bad news?\nTaimi: Great idea! Good news first! Feast your eyes and blindfolds on this!\nRytlock Brimstone: Different tile on the ground? Impressive.\nTaimi: No! This is another one of Rata Novus's secrets I discovered!\nTaimi: Stand there and you'll be ported to this crazy simulation room the Novans developed but never finished.\n<Character name>: And you finished it?\nTaimi: Well... no. I couldn't... you know... figure it out.\nRytlock Brimstone: What's that?\nTaimi: I couldn't figure it out, okay?\nTaimi: Just so happens to fall outside my giant, incredibly deep pool of knowledge— Whatever! It works now.\nTaimi: I called in Moto, an asura with some experience in that realm. He got it up and running for me!\nRytlock Brimstone: What's it do?\nTaimi: It can process numerous experimental theories, but the Rata Novans developed it to test themselves against various Primordus minions.\nTaimi: Wanna check it out?\n<Character name>: Sure, it'll be helpful to find out what we're about to go up against.\nTaimi: Perfect! It'll also help me run some numbers and see what the room's capable of!\nIn the testing room\nTaimi: It's booting up, hold please... Okay! Wave one incoming, folks!\n<Character name>: Ready, Rytlock?\nRytlock Brimstone: It's fake fighting. How hard can it be?\nTaimi: I'll note any patterns or specific attacks I see while you're taking care of business.\nTaimi: They'll only help us out when we face the real deal.\nAfter the first wave\n<Character name>: You've done some amazing work here, Taimi. When do you ever sleep?\nTaimi: No time for that, Commander.\nTaimi: It was one thing going against Mordremoth—of course you want to save the planet—but being asura and facing Primordus...\n<Character name>: Well, I hope you know we're all behind you.\n<Character name>: I thought we had our hands full with Caudecus and Lazarus, but I think we can squeeze in a quick trip to the Shiverpeaks to take down a dragon.\nTaimi: Wellllll, there's a little more I haven't told you yet.\nTaimi: According to what I documented, Primordus is awake—you know this. But here's the more part...\nTaimi: It's moved! Tunneled its way down to the Fire Islands, south of Maguuma.\nRytlock Brimstone: If we know where it is now, let's just go knock on its door and give it a welcome basket.\n<Character name>: Why did it move?\nTaimi: I posit Mordremoth's death and the subsequent magic release must have jump-started Primordus. And then, with a lot of energy pooling in the south...\nTaimi: What better place to feed?\n<Character name>: So it relocated...to get more powerful. Great.\nAfter the second wave\nTaimi: So...while we have the time, there's something else I need to tell you...just a tiny bit more. It's the bad news part.\n<Character name>: Go on...\nTaimi: You ready for this? I don't think you're ready for this... Maybe you should sit down.\nTaimi: No! Stand! Stay standing. Okay, here it is... Jormag is ALSO active!\n<Character name>: What? How can you be sure? I thought most of this tech was focused on Primordus.\nTaimi: Braham sent a letter from the Shiverpeaks.\nRytlock Brimstone: What did it say?\nTaimi: \"Jormag is active. —Braham.\"\nTaimi: He's a norn of few words.\n<Character name>: Two dragons at once...\nTaimi: Yeah, but, there's a silver lining? Neither one has gone all Mordremoth on us. Well, so far...\nTaimi: There's such an excess of energy out there, all the old rule books are being rewritten. Oh look! The next wave is ready!\nWhen the third wave starts\nRytlock Brimstone: That... seems out of place.\n<Character name>: I'm going to go out on a limb and say Primordus doesn't have monkey minions. Unless they've somehow changed...a lot.\nTaimi: Oooooh! That Moto! I left him alone with the room's code for two minutes!\nAfter defeating the Destroyer of Bananas\n<Character name>: How are we doing against the simulation, Taimi?\nTaimi: You still don't have the high score. That belongs to Cami, one of the Fire Islands raiding party leaders.\nTaimi: She's super tough, though, sooo...\nRytlock Brimstone: Another Asura in here? I thought you were keeping all this a secret.\nTaimi: I had to let Cami in on it.\nTaimi: A) she's cool, don't worry. And B) someone had to watch our backs while Moto and I got this thing up and running.\n<Character name>: You already have people in the Fire Islands?\nTaimi: I have some more, let's say \"trusted associates\" there setting up a gate and scouting.\nTaimi: But Phlunt really organized the whole operation. Primordus's movement was something I purposely let slip.\nTaimi: It's good because it keeps him out of my ears for a little while, and it also makes him feel like a big shot.\n<Character name>: Only sixteen years old and you're puppet-mastering one of your superiors...\n<Character name>: Admirable and a little unsettling, Taimi.\nTaimi: I'll soon RULE YOU ALL! (evil laugh) Sorry. Was the comm open for that? Big bad coming up!\nAfter the final wave\nTaimi: That was the last wave. Good job!\nTaimi: You've generated a ton of data for me to sift through. This room could probably run any simulation I can dream up!\nTaimi: As soon as I get Moto in here again to debug it... Come on out!\nAfter exiting the simulation\n<Character name>: Outside a few monkey anomalies, the room was very impressive. Next time, you'll have to program in some Jormag minions.\n<Character name>: Any idea what's happening with the other Elder Dragons?\nTaimi: Nothing on Kralkatorrik, and ditto for... Oh, what's its name? Brain malfunction. Starts with an s...?\nRytlock Brimstone: What about a weakness? All this machinery has to be good for something!\nTaimi: Why don't you channel some patience from the Mists there, Tribune!\nTaimi: A whole civilization of brilliant asura couldn't find it, but, yeah, I got this in five minutes!\nRytlock Brimstone: Maybe if you were as open with your research as you were with your mouth, you'd have cracked it by now!\nTaimi: You're going to lecture me on openness?\nTaimi: Remind me again, what happened to you in the Mists? Oh, that's right, zipper-lips!\n<Character name>: Okay, okay. We're all on the same team here. But...have you made any progress?\nTaimi: Only a few huge leaps! First, remember my chak organ?\n<Character name>: That horribly disgusting body part of an even more horribly disgusting giant bug you keep in a despicable blighting pod fluid?\n<Character name>: Yes, I remember, despite desperately trying to forget.\nTaimi: I named it Spencer!\nRytlock Brimstone: And it's somehow more disturbing.\nTaimi: Don't listen to them, Spence!\nTaimi: Anyway, I discovered why ley energy is different when run through him, and it's paradigm-shifting!\nTaimi: The chak feed off ley energy, right?\nTaimi: And we know that each dragon has a \"domain\" when it comes to their magic; Zhaitan's was death, obviously.\nTaimi: Well you know what's guaranteed to give chak a bad stomachache? Death magic!\nTaimi: Spencer filters \"death\" out of ley energy!\n<Character name>: So magic is almost like light? Broken up into a spectrum?\nTaimi: That's a perfect way to think about it!\nTaimi: Magic as we know it is like white light, composed of all the different types of dragon magic.\nTaimi: I'm gonna go down in asuran history logs for this discovery!\nRytlock Brimstone: As much as I love discussing minutiae, how does this help us?\nTaimi: I don't know yet... But I will! I'll never sleep again!\nTaimi: Now, I'm sure you're anxious to try out your moves against the real thing in the Fire Islands, so let's head back to the main lab.\nUpon arriving back in the main lab\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Rytlock Brimstone.\nRytlock Brimstone: That's \"Tribune\" to you, soldier.\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Not any more, it's not.\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: You've ignored numerous requests from the Black Citadel to account for your time in the Mists and explain this new...magic.\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Thus, you've been stripped of your rank and are hereby charged with dereliction of duty.\nVeteran Vikon: You're to come with us, Rytlock... Sir.\nRytlock Brimstone: And if I don't?\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: We've been authorized to use force.\nVeteran Vikon: But we'd hate to cause a scene.\nRytlock Brimstone: I'm sure you would, pup.\nRytlock Brimstone: Getting this assignment, you two must either be the best warriors in the Iron Legion, or the ones with the worst luck...\nRytlock Brimstone: So?\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Top of my class.\nVeteran Vikon: But it's starting to feel like both...\n<Character name>: Rytlock?\nRytlock Brimstone: It's okay, Commander. I'll straighten this out. It appears I underestimated the citadel's response.\nRytlock Brimstone: Hope you enjoy the medal I'm earning you today, soldier. You get to return with Rytlock Brimstone in tow.\nVeteran Vikon: Without a fight?\nRytlock Brimstone: Depends on my travel accommodations.\nVeteran Vikon: You can have my seat!\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: C'mon, Vikon, you gonna groom him too?\nRytlock Brimstone: Sorry I'll miss out on all the fun, Commander. I'll catch up with you as soon as I'm able.\nAfter Rytlock leaves with the two charr soldiers\n<Character name>: Well, looks like I'm headed to Fire Islands solo.\nTaimi: Sorry, I'd join you, but I just haven't had many moments to work on Scruffy 2.0.\nTaimi: Plus, I need to start experimenting on the thing I told you about in the thing about the new thing findings...\n<Character name>: I understand?\nWindall: Help! Someone help!\nTaimi: Windall, what happened?\nWindall: The Fire Islands! Our party...lost. We shouldn't have strayed from the main outposts!\nWindall: Cami held them off as long [sic] she could, but...\nTaimi: No! Did she make it?\nWindall: No. She... They changed, Taimi. The destroyers there.\nTaimi: Oh!\n<Character name>: Changed? How?\nWindall: Like Risen... and Mordrem. Unstoppable.\nTaimi: Risen and Mordrem? What do you mean?\nWindall: They're not like they were. Different attacks, a different...feel. I don't—\nTaimi: It's okay, it's okay. Take him away and get him some care.\n<Character name>: What do you think that all meant?\nTaimi: Not sure. He could have— (gasp) Of course! It's like you said about the monkey!\nTaimi: They changed! It's... That's why Mordremoth was able to... The Mordrem, Commander!\n<Character name>: What about them?\nTaimi: The ones who came from the blighting pods! Mordremoth had its minions, the sylvari, right?\nTaimi: But it was able to create more, new ones from the dead! That power came from Zhaitan!\nTaimi: Killing Zhaitan caused the other dragons to absorb the death spectrum, but we only saw it in Mordremoth because it was active.\nTaimi: Then we killed Mordremoth, and now Primordus has absorbed some of the death and planty-ness! I think...\n<Character name>: Can we test that theory? I'll go and get you a sample from these new destroyers.\nTaimi: That'd be amazing, Commander! Be careful, and let me know what you find!\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIf you put down a personal waypoint while in the simulation, it will be located next to Rata Novus Waypoint.",

      "strWikiText": "Dragon Vigil is the final part of Rising Flames.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nCheck on the egg in Tarir.\n\nReturn to the egg chamber.\nHead to the egg chamber.\nHold Vigil over the egg.\nMake your way to the hatchling.\n(Defend the hatchling while the Exalted reboot the chamber's defenses.)\nExalted Shield \nTalk to Marjory.\nTalk to Caithe.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n  Gilded Strongbox\n  Dragonite Ore (5)\n  Unbound Magic (consumed automatically for 50 Unbound Magic)\n  Bag of Loot (5)\n  Pamphlet of Wisdom\nUpon replaying\n  Memory of Aurene (2-3) (Rewarded after defending Aurene from death-branded)\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\nYou will not be able to reach the entrance to the story mission if the Battle in Tarir map meta event has closed off access to Tarir.  The Forgotten City Waypoint becomes contested when the map meta event starts every two hours. Make sure to check the Event Timers wiki page or enter \"/wiki et\" into the in-game chat box.  You will have to wait until the meta is over and the city is accessible again to start this mission.  \nSpeak to Ruka the Wanderer.  Reaching Ruka is not obvious because he is on the lower level of Tarir.  On the main map or the mini-map look for the 'Down' arrow symbol just northeast of the Forgotten City Waypoint, the tan arrow blends with the background coloring on both maps so it can be initially missed.  This will lead to an obscured hole in the floor that will lead down to the lower level.  Talk to Ruka, then head through the door, into the room towards the egg, and you are almost instantly thrust into battle. This instance is all about enduring a constant siege of destroyers. Focus on killing the Veterans to trigger the next stage, and pay attention when a pod is put down to explode and knock off the shield.\nAfter about 3 Veterans are killed, Lazarus will appear and aid in the defense. There will be one or two more veterans before the Destroyer of Hope spawns. Kill it, and the siege is over. Like most of the new destroyers, it gains vulnerability from being chilled. Hitting it with the exploding pods will also increase its incoming damage by 300%, so do this as often as you can and then hit it with everything you have. During the fight, the Pact Commander is given access to a special action key ability from Lazarus known as Spectral Smite.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nSimply complete the episode.\n\nCan be done on the first play-through, and is significantly easier to do with a party than solo.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Dragon Duty effect.\n\nDon't let any of the Destroyer Bombs explode near Aurene.\n\nMay require at least several playthroughs to achieve. Only counts for the person throwing the bombs, and destroyers must be killed within the active field.\n\nCan be done on the first play-through. Simply do not let Aurene's shield drop below half health.\nSkills and classes that summon minions or turrets can make this achievement easier to achieve, as enemies will attack them rather than the shield. In addition, stun, slow, and immobilize skills will give you more time to kill enemies before they can get too close.\nSome enemies spawn on the platform rather than on the stairs, so be careful of them.\nEnemies will continue spawning until the Veteran Destroyer of Hope is killed, as such it's recommended to kill it as quickly as possible.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nDragon\nAurene\nExalted\nRuka the Wanderer\nLuminate\nHuman\nMarjory Delaqua\nMursaat\nLazarus\nSylvari\nCaithe\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nDestroyers\nDeath-Touched Destroyer\nVeteran Corrupted Destroyer\nVeteran Death-Touched Destroyer\nVeteran Destroyer of Hope\nVeteran Rotting Destroyer\nVine-Touched Destroyer\nRotting Destroyer\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nTalking to Ruka\n\nRuka the Wanderer: Commander! Thank Glint! We tried to get word to you. I contacted your friends to see if they could locate you, too.\n<Character name>: The egg called to me. Is everything okay?\nRuka the Wanderer: Yes, most okay! It's hatching, Commander. Glint's second scion will soon be here.\n<Character name>: That's— We should get inside! Marjory...and Caithe. You called Caithe, too...\nCaithe: I wasn't called, but... I was nearby and word spread fast. This is very exciting.\nMarjory Delaqua: Where's Rytlock? I thought he was with you.\n<Character name>: He's indisposed. Ruka, can we all go in?\nRuka the Wanderer: I'm sorry, but you're still the only one attuned to the chamber. The magical barrier will not allow us.\nMarjory Delaqua: Great. I'll just stay out here with Cai—...The glowy guy.\nCaithe: It will give us a chance to catch up, Marjory.\nMarjory Delaqua: Don't be gone too long, Commander! (sigh)\nCinematic upon entering the Inner Chamber\n\nLuminate: Get back!\nLuminate: Commander, the chamber! Something's wrong! Hold them off while I right this!\nUpon approaching the hatchling\n\n<Character name>: What is it? Why is the barrier down?\nLuminate: The chamber is designed to reattune to the newborn's unique signature, but this technology is centuries old!\nLuminate: Something must have malfunctioned. Keep them away from me. I'll repair this as soon as I'm able!\nLuminate: I need to focus on the chamber's defenses! Keep the destroyers away from Glint's hatchling.\nUpon Lazarus's arrival\n\n<Character name>: Lazarus! Leave! Immediately!\n<Character name>: Marjory! Caithe!\nLazarus: They're tied up in battle as well. I do not come with ill intentions!\n<Character name>: Then earn my goodwill. Don't let the destroyers up those stairs.\n<Character name>: And give the dragon a wide berth, Lazarus! It would be a pity to have your second life be short lived!\nAfter the battle\n\nMarjory Delaqua: Sorry, we got held up outside. Destroyers... What's happening?\nLuminate: It's done, Commander! The barrier has been restored. The scion of Glint is safe.\n<Character name>: Not until that mursaat is out of here.\nLuminate: A mursaat? The Forgotten passed on tales of these creatures. I never thought I'd encounter one...\nLuminate: You are the dragon's champion and shepherd, but may I suggest purging this impurity directly.\nLazarus: The mursaat I was in the tales of the Forgotten is dead. I have been reborn, and rising from the void brings with it a new perspective.\nLazarus: We previously sought power through treacherous means, only to save ourselves when the dragons rose.\nLazarus: But now I see we must all stand against the dragons to save everyone.\n<Character name>: You hope to align yourself with me?\nLazarus: You have killed two, have you not? Our interests are the same.\nLazarus: The fire dragon is rising. I cannot stand idly by and repeat past mistakes.\nLazarus: My actions since returning prove me a useful ally.\nMarjory Delaqua: Like when you destroyed the Bloodstone?\nLazarus: The Bloodstone was destabilized by years of misguided White Mantle tinkering.\nLazarus: I did absorb the blast to repower myself, but also, how many countless lives were saved?\nMarjory Delaqua: What's the angle you're running? What's in an alliance for you?\nLazarus: The salvation of this world.\nLazarus: The White Mantle is splintering. Those who follow Caudecus, and those loyal to me.\nLazarus: I can make them a force for good; another spear in an army against the dragons.\nLuminate: This is the same accord the mursaat struck with the Forgotten; then, they simply broke their word and disappeared.\nLazarus: That was a cowardly act of self-preservation, and something I will not repeat.\n<Character name>: You seem earnest enough, so I hope you'll understand when I tell you there's no way I can agree to this.\n<Character name>: I can't keep an eye on you at all times.\nMarjory Delaqua: I have an idea, Commander. I'll do it.\nMarjory Delaqua: I'll dig into his claim, and if Lazarus has truly changed, we can reassess the situation.\nLazarus: I welcome any inquiries.\nMarjory Delaqua: Oh, it'll be much more than that. I'm going to be embedded with you, shadow your every move.\n<Character name>: Marjory, can I speak with you a moment?\nTalking to Marjory\n\n<Character name>: What are you doing? He absorbed the Bloodstone's power. We obviously can't just easily put him down if his story doesn't check out.\nMarjory Delaqua: He's touched death, Commander, and now he's back... There's something... The necromancer in me wants to find out more.\nMarjory Delaqua: And...who knows?\n<Character name>: I can't let you do that. It could be a trap. It's probably a trap. It's almost certainly a trap.\nMarjory Delaqua: There's something about him... Makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.\nMarjory Delaqua: And I can't tell if it's in a good way or a bad way, but I do plan to find out.\nMarjory Delaqua: I'm glad to be part of Dragon's Watch, and I appreciate you looking out for me, but I won't be told what I can and can't do.\nMarjory Delaqua: Lazarus, let's move out. We have a lot to talk about, my floaty new friend.\nLazarus: Hmm.\nTalking to Caithe\n\n<Character name>: I can't help but feel like I'll be explaining this to Kasmeer shortly.\n<Character name>: Given what happened today, I'd feel a little better if someone I knew was watching the chamber.\nCaithe: Someone you trust?\n<Character name>: Yes. So, could you ask Taimi to get here right away?\nCaithe: You're joking with me. I take that as a good sign.\n<Character name>: You've been a lot of things, Caithe, but you've never been an enemy of this dragon.\nCaithe: I'll lay down my life for... What should we call it?\n<Character name>: Her. Her name is Aurene.\nCaithe: You decided that quite fast.\n<Character name>: It wasn't a decision. I just...knew.\nCaithe: Then no harm will come to Aurene while I still breathe.\n<Character name>: Thanks, Caithe. After the coming battle with this changed, more powerful Primordus, I hope any of us are still breathing.\nTalking to Caithe again\n\nCaithe: Changed and more powerful? Care to explain?\n<Character name>: I was just in the Fire Islands; Primordus moved down there. Taimi and I discovered that its minions have evolved.\n<Character name>: They're showing signs of Zhaitan and Mordremoth influences. I also found a dwarf head, but... Long story.\nCaithe: So when we kill a dragon...?\n<Character name>: The others absorb the loose power.\nCaithe: Then I suppose we must kill them all before any one grows too powerful.\n<Character name>: Seems like an increasingly difficult task...\nCaithe: Indeed.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThere is a challenge mission in Guild Wars: Eye of the North, Glint's Challenge, with a similar objective of protecting Glint's offspring from destroyers.",

I have some good news and bad news.\n<Character name>: What's the bad news?\nTaimi: Great idea! Good news first! Feast your eyes and blindfolds on this!\nRytlock Brimstone: Different tile on the ground? Impressive.\nTaimi: No! This is another one of Rata Novus's secrets I discovered!\nTaimi: Stand there and you'll be ported to this crazy simulation room the Novans developed but never finished.\n<Character name>: And you finished it?\nTaimi: Well... no. I couldn't... you know... figure it out.\nRytlock Brimstone: What's that?\nTaimi: I couldn't figure it out, okay?\nTaimi: Just so happens to fall outside my giant, incredibly deep pool of knowledge— Whatever! It works now.\nTaimi: I called in Moto, an asura with some experience in that realm. He got it up and running for me!\nRytlock Brimstone: What's it do?\nTaimi: It can process numerous experimental theories, but the Rata Novans developed it to test themselves against various Primordus minions.\nTaimi: Wanna check it out?\n<Character name>: Sure, it'll be helpful to find out what we're about to go up against.\nTaimi: Perfect! It'll also help me run some numbers and see what the room's capable of!\nIn the testing room\nTaimi: It's booting up, hold please... Okay! Wave one incoming, folks!\n<Character name>: Ready, Rytlock?\nRytlock Brimstone: It's fake fighting. How hard can it be?\nTaimi: I'll note any patterns or specific attacks I see while you're taking care of business.\nTaimi: They'll only help us out when we face the real deal.\nAfter the first wave\n<Character name>: You've done some amazing work here, Taimi. When do you ever sleep?\nTaimi: No time for that, Commander.\nTaimi: It was one thing going against Mordremoth—of course you want to save the planet—but being asura and facing Primordus...\n<Character name>: Well, I hope you know we're all behind you.\n<Character name>: I thought we had our hands full with Caudecus and Lazarus, but I think we can squeeze in a quick trip to the Shiverpeaks to take down a dragon.\nTaimi: Wellllll, there's a little more I haven't told you yet.\nTaimi: According to what I documented, Primordus is awake—you know this. But here's the more part...\nTaimi: It's moved! Tunneled its way down to the Fire Islands, south of Maguuma.\nRytlock Brimstone: If we know where it is now, let's just go knock on its door and give it a welcome basket.\n<Character name>: Why did it move?\nTaimi: I posit Mordremoth's death and the subsequent magic release must have jump-started Primordus. And then, with a lot of energy pooling in the south...\nTaimi: What better place to feed?\n<Character name>: So it relocated...to get more powerful. Great.\nAfter the second wave\nTaimi: So...while we have the time, there's something else I need to tell you...just a tiny bit more. It's the bad news part.\n<Character name>: Go on...\nTaimi: You ready for this? I don't think you're ready for this... Maybe you should sit down.\nTaimi: No! Stand! Stay standing. Okay, here it is... Jormag is ALSO active!\n<Character name>: What? How can you be sure? I thought most of this tech was focused on Primordus.\nTaimi: Braham sent a letter from the Shiverpeaks.\nRytlock Brimstone: What did it say?\nTaimi: \"Jormag is active. —Braham.\"\nTaimi: He's a norn of few words.\n<Character name>: Two dragons at once...\nTaimi: Yeah, but, there's a silver lining? Neither one has gone all Mordremoth on us. Well, so far...\nTaimi: There's such an excess of energy out there, all the old rule books are being rewritten. Oh look! The next wave is ready!\nWhen the third wave starts\nRytlock Brimstone: That... seems out of place.\n<Character name>: I'm going to go out on a limb and say Primordus doesn't have monkey minions. Unless they've somehow changed...a lot.\nTaimi: Oooooh! That Moto! I left him alone with the room's code for two minutes!\nAfter defeating the Destroyer of Bananas\n<Character name>: How are we doing against the simulation, Taimi?\nTaimi: You still don't have the high score. That belongs to Cami, one of the Fire Islands raiding party leaders.\nTaimi: She's super tough, though, sooo...\nRytlock Brimstone: Another Asura in here? I thought you were keeping all this a secret.\nTaimi: I had to let Cami in on it.\nTaimi: A) she's cool, don't worry. And B) someone had to watch our backs while Moto and I got this thing up and running.\n<Character name>: You already have people in the Fire Islands?\nTaimi: I have some more, let's say \"trusted associates\" there setting up a gate and scouting.\nTaimi: But Phlunt really organized the whole operation. Primordus's movement was something I purposely let slip.\nTaimi: It's good because it keeps him out of my ears for a little while, and it also makes him feel like a big shot.\n<Character name>: Only sixteen years old and you're puppet-mastering one of your superiors...\n<Character name>: Admirable and a little unsettling, Taimi.\nTaimi: I'll soon RULE YOU ALL! (evil laugh) Sorry. Was the comm open for that? Big bad coming up!\nAfter the final wave\nTaimi: That was the last wave. Good job!\nTaimi: You've generated a ton of data for me to sift through. This room could probably run any simulation I can dream up!\nTaimi: As soon as I get Moto in here again to debug it... Come on out!\nAfter exiting the simulation\n<Character name>: Outside a few monkey anomalies, the room was very impressive. Next time, you'll have to program in some Jormag minions.\n<Character name>: Any idea what's happening with the other Elder Dragons?\nTaimi: Nothing on Kralkatorrik, and ditto for... Oh, what's its name? Brain malfunction. Starts with an s...?\nRytlock Brimstone: What about a weakness? All this machinery has to be good for something!\nTaimi: Why don't you channel some patience from the Mists there, Tribune!\nTaimi: A whole civilization of brilliant asura couldn't find it, but, yeah, I got this in five minutes!\nRytlock Brimstone: Maybe if you were as open with your research as you were with your mouth, you'd have cracked it by now!\nTaimi: You're going to lecture me on openness?\nTaimi: Remind me again, what happened to you in the Mists? Oh, that's right, zipper-lips!\n<Character name>: Okay, okay. We're all on the same team here. But...have you made any progress?\nTaimi: Only a few huge leaps! First, remember my chak organ?\n<Character name>: That horribly disgusting body part of an even more horribly disgusting giant bug you keep in a despicable blighting pod fluid?\n<Character name>: Yes, I remember, despite desperately trying to forget.\nTaimi: I named it Spencer!\nRytlock Brimstone: And it's somehow more disturbing.\nTaimi: Don't listen to them, Spence!\nTaimi: Anyway, I discovered why ley energy is different when run through him, and it's paradigm-shifting!\nTaimi: The chak feed off ley energy, right?\nTaimi: And we know that each dragon has a \"domain\" when it comes to their magic; Zhaitan's was death, obviously.\nTaimi: Well you know what's guaranteed to give chak a bad stomachache? Death magic!\nTaimi: Spencer filters \"death\" out of ley energy!\n<Character name>: So magic is almost like light? Broken up into a spectrum?\nTaimi: That's a perfect way to think about it!\nTaimi: Magic as we know it is like white light, composed of all the different types of dragon magic.\nTaimi: I'm gonna go down in asuran history logs for this discovery!\nRytlock Brimstone: As much as I love discussing minutiae, how does this help us?\nTaimi: I don't know yet... But I will! I'll never sleep again!\nTaimi: Now, I'm sure you're anxious to try out your moves against the real thing in the Fire Islands, so let's head back to the main lab.\nUpon arriving back in the main lab\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Rytlock Brimstone.\nRytlock Brimstone: That's \"Tribune\" to you, soldier.\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Not any more, it's not.\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: You've ignored numerous requests from the Black Citadel to account for your time in the Mists and explain this new...magic.\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Thus, you've been stripped of your rank and are hereby charged with dereliction of duty.\nVeteran Vikon: You're to come with us, Rytlock... Sir.\nRytlock Brimstone: And if I don't?\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: We've been authorized to use force.\nVeteran Vikon: But we'd hate to cause a scene.\nRytlock Brimstone: I'm sure you would, pup.\nRytlock Brimstone: Getting this assignment, you two must either be the best warriors in the Iron Legion, or the ones with the worst luck...\nRytlock Brimstone: So?\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: Top of my class.\nVeteran Vikon: But it's starting to feel like both...\n<Character name>: Rytlock?\nRytlock Brimstone: It's okay, Commander. I'll straighten this out. It appears I underestimated the citadel's response.\nRytlock Brimstone: Hope you enjoy the medal I'm earning you today, soldier. You get to return with Rytlock Brimstone in tow.\nVeteran Vikon: Without a fight?\nRytlock Brimstone: Depends on my travel accommodations.\nVeteran Vikon: You can have my seat!\nVeteran Adamant Team Lead: C'mon, Vikon, you gonna groom him too?\nRytlock Brimstone: Sorry I'll miss out on all the fun, Commander. I'll catch up with you as soon as I'm able.\nAfter Rytlock leaves with the two charr soldiers\n<Character name>: Well, looks like I'm headed to Fire Islands solo.\nTaimi: Sorry, I'd join you, but I just haven't had many moments to work on Scruffy 2.0.\nTaimi: Plus, I need to start experimenting on the thing I told you about in the thing about the new thing findings...\n<Character name>: I understand?\nWindall: Help! Someone help!\nTaimi: Windall, what happened?\nWindall: The Fire Islands! Our party...lost. We shouldn't have strayed from the main outposts!\nWindall: Cami held them off as long [sic] she could, but...\nTaimi: No! Did she make it?\nWindall: No. She... They changed, Taimi. The destroyers there.\nTaimi: Oh!\n<Character name>: Changed? How?\nWindall: Like Risen... and Mordrem. Unstoppable.\nTaimi: Risen and Mordrem? What do you mean?\nWindall: They're not like they were. Different attacks, a different...feel. I don't—\nTaimi: It's okay, it's okay. Take him away and get him some care.\n<Character name>: What do you think that all meant?\nTaimi: Not sure. He could have— (gasp) Of course! It's like you said about the monkey!\nTaimi: They changed! It's... That's why Mordremoth was able to... The Mordrem, Commander!\n<Character name>: What about them?\nTaimi: The ones who came from the blighting pods! Mordremoth had its minions, the sylvari, right?\nTaimi: But it was able to create more, new ones from the dead! That power came from Zhaitan!\nTaimi: Killing Zhaitan caused the other dragons to absorb the death spectrum, but we only saw it in Mordremoth because it was active.\nTaimi: Then we killed Mordremoth, and now Primordus has absorbed some of the death and planty-ness! I think...\n<Character name>: Can we test that theory? I'll go and get you a sample from these new destroyers.\nTaimi: That'd be amazing, Commander! Be careful, and let me know what you find!\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIf you put down a personal waypoint while in the simulation, it will be located next to Rata Novus Waypoint.",

There is an achievement for finding (and giving to the Priory arcanist) the toys, found underwater in the far southern part of the chamber.\n\nEncounter 2\nEscort the Vigil soldiers to safety, one at a time. After interacting with the Vigil medic, destroy the two portals that spawn before talking to any of the other Vigil wounded. That will give you the best chance of keeping them all alive. A second set of portals spawn at halfpoint, prioritize destroying these as well.\n\nEncounter 3\nEscort Aurene through the labyrinth, killing ooze as they appear. Only Aurene can turn off the four glob generators. It is possible to become swamped by Elite Ghastly Ooze that constantly spam Immobile attacks, making progress difficult.  You should try to keep moving toward the generators, pulling the mobs with you, killing any that aggro Aurene to make your way closer to each one. However if you are defeated and restart from a checkpoint it will remember any generators you destroyed and clear out all the ooze, so deliberately dying can be a useful tool to complete this.\n\nEncounter 4\nYou fight a Mordrem Leyleecher that heals as it attacks you. \n\nThe mob will be completely invulnerable to all attacks and eventually a small white circle will appear.  Aurene will move to the circle and a larger, second white circle will appear on the direct opposite side of the mob.  Immediately get into this larger circle, and once inside the large circle you will be given a special ability called Coordinated Attack.\nQuickly execute the Coordinated Attack once you are in the large white circle.  This will make the mob become vulnerable for a very short amount of time.  Attack the mob for as much damage as possible during this window.  The mob will quickly become invulnerable again and you must -immediately- get off the platform into the water and behind a pillar as quickly as possible or you will be pulled back and the mob will heal itself.\nUse the pillars to prevent its Pull and Siphon Combined attack. Staying exactly behind a pillar will keep you from being pulled back onto the platform and allowing the mob to heal.\nIn addition to the pillars, you may swim underwater and get behind the section that juts out from the rest of the platform, this area is right beside the stairs, and takes a little finesse to angle the depth of your character with the camera angle to see the white circles. You will be pulled be the Mordrem Leyleecher, but you should not be close enough that it can siphon health from you.\nWait until the mob eventually does an AOE attacks that shows up as a long orange rectangle.  After this attack the white circles should re-appear.  You may need to try different pillars to find one that gives the best view of the platform.\nDuring this attack, swim back. If you time it right, you can get into the large white circle in time to activate the special shout.\nAfter the shout, inflict as much damage as possible in the very short window that is open before the mob becomes invulnerable again.\nSwim back behind a pillar and wait again.  If the mob is able to hit with Pull and Siphon attacks, you will have to this repeatedly and wait extended periods for the mob to eventually attack again with orange rectangle.\nYou cannot remain on the platform or the mob will constantly heal themselves to full health by spamming its Pull and Siphon attack. Even if your character is able to survive the mob's attacks, it will not matter because the mob will easily recover any damage done during the Coordinated Attacks unless you prevent it from repeatedly executing the Pull and Siphon. \nIt is advised not to use minions, as the Mordrem Leyleecher will siphon life from them to stay alive. \n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nComplete the instance.\n\nDon't let the Mordrem kill any of the soldiers. This can be accomplished on the first playthrough.\nIf solo, load up on burst and AoE skills and stand where one of the portals will spawn. When the Mordrem attack, focus on taking out the portal on one side, using AoE to hit both the portal and the Mordrem. Once it's down, run to the other side and attack the other Mordrem and bring them over to the portal and do the same. When both portals are down, interact with a wounded vigil on the sides first and run over to the shield. You can get about 3-4 wounded over to it before the next portals spawn. Once they do, ignore the wounded vigil and take out the portals in the same way. Aurene starts moving wounded vigil over once you do the first, and should be able to finish up the wounded while you're distracting the Mordrem and going after the portals.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Vigilant effect.\n\nThe Bundle of Children's Toys is located to the south of the room where Aurene checks the cages for fish. The chest is located underwater and will be automatically looted when you get near. Can be accessed when gathering fish from cages during Help the Needy objective and is automatically turned in after cooking the fish.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  New in Box effect.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nTaimi (voice only)\nDragons\nAurene\nExalted\nLuminate\nExalted Sage\nVeteran Exalted Sage\nVeteran Tarnished Sage\nPhantasms\nChild\nPriory Arcanist\nProjection of Aurene\nVigil Medic\nWounded Vigil\nSylvari\nCaithe\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nPhantasms\nElite Ghastly Ooze\nMordrem Husk\nMordrem Leyleecher\nOoze\nSkelk Scavenger\n\n\n== Objects ==\nEnemy Portal\nFish Smoker\nOoze Generator\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\nStarting the Episode\nA projection of Aurene appears near the Commander.\n<Character name>: Aurene? What are you doing out here?\n<Character name>: That was...odd. Must've been some sort of projection.\n<Character name>: I should return to Tarir. Something strange is going on.\nSpeaking to Luminate\nLuminate: Ah, Commander. Excellent timing—I was just about to send word. Aurene has been calling for you.\n<Character name>: Yes, I know. She's been appearing to me. Much like she is right now.\nLuminate: Aurene? What are you talking about?\n<Character name>: And she's gone. Didn't you see her?\nLuminate: Interesting... I saw nothing. You must've made quite an impression on her. It's as if she's chosen you to light her path.\nLuminate: For now, Aurene is just an infant, forming her first pictures of the world around her.\nLuminate: But make no mistake: she'll one day achieve great power. As her guardians, it's our duty to set her down the right path.\n<Character name>: I'm at Aurene's disposal. What's the plan?\nLuminate: A bond already exists between the two of you. Our goal is to nurture and strengthen that bond.\nLuminate: To that end, we've prepared a series of challenges meant to demonstrate virtues to the hatchling.\nLuminate: In the chambers ahead, you will help the needy, defend the weak, and train Aurene for battle.\nLuminate: In the final chamber waits the truest test of your bond: a foe that you can only defeat with Aurene's trust and help.\n<Character name>: We've got our work cut out for us. Is Aurene ready for this?\nLuminate: She'll be fine. Just be patient with her. Aurene's at a...rambunctious age, and she sees everything as play.\nLuminate: Step through the portal when you're ready.\nSpeaking to Caithe\nCaithe: Welcome back, Commander. Do you have a moment?\n<Character name>: Caithe. How are things going here?\nCaithe: Quiet, for the most part. Between the Exalted and myself, Aurene has a lot of eyes watching over her.\nCaithe: I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you letting me stand guard over her, after all that's happened.\nCaithe: I want you to trust me like you did before.\n<Character name>: Mordremoth turned all of our worlds upside down.\nCaithe: That's putting it lightly.\nCaithe: Since the Firstborn awoke, our trust and faith in the Pale Mother has been absolute. Then we heard the call of our creator—our true creator.\nCaithe: That creator now lies vanquished. Where does that leave the sylvari? What is our place in this new world we've created?\nCaithe: No one can answer those questions for us. We must answer them with action. There is much to do.\n(if sylvari)\n<Character name>: It'll take time. But our people will find a way forward. I'm certain of it.\n(if not sylvari)\n<Character name>: It'll take time. But I'm sure you and your people will find a way forward.\nCaithe: Thank you, Commander. Don't let me keep you. I've got things well looked after here.\nSpeaking to Luminate again\nDo you have any questions before you begin?\n Tell me more about helping the needy.\nWe've simulated an encounter with a guardian escorting orphaned children. They're out of food and need assistance. You will illustrate the virtues of charity and selflessness for Aurene's benefit.\n I see.\n Tell me more about defending the weak.\nWe've simulated an encounter with sick and wounded Vigil who are fending off a Mordrem ambush. You will help them and thus teach the hatchling about honor and mercy.\n I see.\n Tell me more about training for battle.\nAurene must learn the ways of combat if she is to survive. You will fight with her and help her overcome her fears. Aurene will learn to trust you and to know the difference between friend and foe.\n I see.\n Tell me more about the final test.\nYou will face a foe that can only be defeated with Aurene's latent magical abilities. Your bond will be tested. You two must work together and trust one another if you hope to overcome this challenge.\n I see.\n No questions. Let's get to work.\nAfter using the portal\n<Character name>: \"Rambunctious age\" indeed. Aurene! Come on out!\n(repeating while searching)\n<Character name>: She's got to be around here somewhere...\n<Character name>: Come on out, Aurene!\n<Character name>: Now where could she be...\n(one of these lines when finding her)\n<Character name>: Ha! Gotcha!\n<Character name>: There you are!\n<Character name>: Found you!\n(one of these lines for the second round of hide and seek)\n<Character name>: Again? Well, all right.\n<Character name>: Guess we're not finished yet, are we?\n(repeating while searching)\n<Character name>: She's got to be around here somewhere...\n<Character name>: Come on out, Aurene!\n<Character name>: Now where could she be...\n(one of these lines when finding her)\n<Character name>: Ha! Gotcha!\n<Character name>: There you are!\n<Character name>: Found you!\n<Character name>: All right, Aurene. We've had our fun, but it's time to get to work, don't you think?\nAfter using the portal\nVeteran Exalted Sage: Commander. Are you ready to demonstrate charity and benevolence to the scion?\n<Character name>: How about it, Aurene? Are we ready?\nAurene: (positive chirp)\nVeteran Exalted Sage: Then let us begin.\nSpeaking to Priory Arcanist\nPriory Arcanist: Oh, thank the Six—I haven't seen another soul in some time. These children are in desperate need, stranger.\n<Character name>: What's going on?\nPriory Arcanist: These kids were orphaned in a vicious attack on their village. They lost everything—their homes, their families.\nPriory Arcanist: I'm taking them to an orphanage, but we've got a long road ahead of us, and we've just run out of food.\nPriory Arcanist: There's good fishing in the shallows nearby, but I can't leave the children... And I'm awful at fishing.\nPriory Arcanist: Could you help us gather some food to get us through the rest of our journey?\n<Character name>: What do you think, Aurene? Should we give them a hand?\nAurene: (positive chirp)\nStart gathering fish\n(one of these lines)\n<Character name>: Aurene, go check the traps.\n<Character name>: Give me a hand with those traps!\n<Character name>: Go see what we've caught, Aurene!\nRetrieve collected fish from Aurene\n<Character name>: Aurene? You're not eating any of that fish, are you?\nAurene: (neutral chirp)\n<Character name>: Because we're supposed to be feeding starving children. Starving ORPHANED children. We'll eat when we're done, okay?\nAurene: (positive chirp)\n<Character name>: I'm going to assume that's dragon for \"understood.\"\nGiving the smoked fish to Priory Arcanist\nPriory Arcanist: This is quite a bounty you've brought us! We should have more than enough to last us through the rest of our journey.\nPriory Arcanist: As a matter of fact, it's almost too much. Here, take some with you. For your companion.\nAurene: (chitters happily)\nIf you collected the toys\n<Character name>: We found some toys while we were out gathering up the fish. Maybe the children could make use of them?\nPriory Arcanist: Oh my — yes, I'm sure we can find a place for these.\nPriory Arcanist: These children have been through a lot, but atleast they won't be going hungry. Thanks so much for the help.\n<Character name>: You hear that, Aurene? You did a lot of good here.\nGiving the smoked fish to Aurene\n<Character name>: Look here, Aurene. I've brought a treat for you.\nAfter using the portal\nVeteran Tarnished Sage: Here you will illustrate the virtues of mercy and honor for Glint's scion. Are you ready, Commander?\nAurene: (positive chirp)\n<Character name>: You heard her. Let's get started.\nVeteran Tarnished Sage: The trial begins...now.\nVigil Medic: Who goes there? Are you friend or foe? State your intentions!\nSpeaking to the Vigil Medic\n<Character name>: Calm down. We mean you no harm. What happened to you?\nVigil Medic: We were ambushed by dragon minions. It was absolute chaos. Our casualties mounted swiftly, so we fell back here.\nVigil Medic: We're tending to the wounded as fast as we can, but the creatures are hot on our trail, and it won't be long before...\nVigil Medic: Wait, do you hear that?\nVigil Medic: Oh no—more of them! We're defenseless! Please, stranger—help us drive them back!\nSpeaking to the Vigil Medic after rescuring wounded Vigil and destroying enemy portals\n<Character name>: That should be all of them. You and your people are safe now.\nVigil Medic: I can't believe we survived. We'd all but given up hope before you came along.\nAurene: (negative fidget)\nVigil Medic: You and your companion, I mean. Thank you both.\n<Character name>: We were happy to help. Good luck on the rest of your journey.\nAfter using the portal\nVeteran Tarnished Sage: Greetings, Commander. This trial is meant to convey the virtues of courage and valor to hatchling. Shall we begin?\n<Character name>: Absolutely.\nVeteran Tarnished Sage: Prepare yourselves.\nAfter destroying the Ooze generators\n<Character name>: I think that's all of them.\nAurene: (positive chirp)\n<Character name>: You fought bravely, Aurene. Good work.\nAfter using the portal\nVeteran Tarnished Sage: Welcome to the last chamber, Commander. Here, you bond with the hatchling will be put a final test.\nVeteran Tarnished Sage: You must work together with the hatchling to defeat the foe that awaits you. Are you prepared to face this challenge?\nAurene: (roar)\n<Character name>: We've come too far to stop now. Let's do it.\nVeteran Tarnished Sage: Ready yourselves. The test begins...now.\nUsing special action skill during final fight\nAurene: (roar)\n<Character name>: I need you, Aurene! Give it all you've got!\n<Character name>: Your moment has arrived! Don't hold back now!\nAfter defeating the final boss\nAurene: (roar)\n<Character name>: That breath attack of yours was phenomenal! Outstanding work!\nAurene: (chitters happily)\n<Character name>: I should speak with the Luminate. You rest now, Aurene. You've earned it.\nAt the Luminate\nLuminate: Well done, Commander. We've given the hatchling the best possible start that we can.\nLuminate: She still has much to learn about her place in the world. But thanks to you, she has a foundation of trust to build on.\nTaimi: Commander? Do you read me? Sorry to interrupt, but I've got some urgent news.\nTaimi: I've been examining that destroyer sample you retrieved, and I've come to a conclusion: I was right! As usual!\n<Character name>: So it's true—the dragons are absorbing each other's influences? And becoming more powerful in the process?\nTaimi: That's right. And there's more.\nTaimi: I've been digging through old Rata Novan research on Primordus for an exploitable weakness, and I found a solid lead.\nTaimi: According to these findings, Primordus's domain of magic can be counteracted somehow, negating it altogether!\nTaimi: As for the possible counteracting agent, I'm still investigating. New answers lead to new questions. What's your status?\n<Character name>: I just finished spending some...quality time with Aurene.\nTaimi: Glad to hear it. Especially if it lessens the likelihood of an older, bigger Aurene going rogue and slaughtering us all.\n<Character name>: I definitely wouldn't object to having a dragon fight with me rather than against me.\nTaimi: There's an appealing thought. I wonder if... (gasp) Commander! That's it!\nTaimi: We need a force that can counter Primordus. What if it's another dragon? An ice dragon, for instance?\nTaimi: Remember what I was telling you about that chak organ? How it could selectively filter certain types of magic?\nTaimi: If we can discern magic types, we may be able to pit Jormag and Primordus against one another, destroying them both at once!\n<Character name>: Are you suggesting we get Jormag and Primordus to fight one another? How?\nTaimi: Not the dragons themselves—their energies. As for how, I'm... not quite sure just yet. Our first task is to test the theory.\n<Character name>: Okay, let's say we pursue this course of action. What comes next?\nTaimi: We confirm the theory in the lab, utilizing small amounts of magic to see if they'll actually counteract one another.\nTaimi: And we'll need an icebrood sample—one showing signs of influence from our dearly departed Mordremoth and Zhaitan.\n<Character name>: Then I'd better get to the Shiverpeaks. I'll find Braham while I'm there and talk to him about joining Dragon's Watch.\nTaimi: I'm sure he'll want to hear all about our new plans for Jormag, too.\nTaimi: I'll get to work on some means of pitting the energies against one another. Good luck in the Shiverpeaks, Commander!\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nOnce this story step has been completed, the character can access a persistent instance with the same name by using the Exalted Portal Stone.",

      "strWikiText": "Bastion of the Penitent is the second raid, consisting of one stand-alone wing. Scholar Glenna found a portal in the wake of the explosion of Bloodstone Fen. Finding themselves in a mysterious area far north of central Tyria, players will discover the mysteries in this unexplored fort and encounter Cairn the Indomitable, Mursaat Overseer, Samarog, and Deimos.\nIt was released alongside the Living World chapter The Head of the Snake on February 8, 2017.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nThe portal for entering the raid Bastion of the Penitent is located just south of Depths of the Maw Waypoint in Bloodstone Fen. The in-game map shows an icon for the portal. Players must be in a raid squad of up to 10 players prior to entering the portal.\nUsing the portal in Lion's Arch Aerodrome. You must join a raid Squad before you can enter the portal.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n== Interactive map ==\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nSpeak With Glenna.\nFollow Glenna.\nDefeat Cairn the Indomitable\nCairn the Indomitable\n\nTime remaining: 8:00\nFollow Glenna inside.\nFind a way past the barricade.\nDefeat Mursaat Overseer\nMursaat Overseer\n\nTime remaining: 6:00\nDefeat Samarog\nSamarog\n\nTime remaining: 11:00\nFree the prisoner from his bonds\nShackled Prisoner\n\nDestroy the demonic chains binding the prisoner.\nDemonic chains destroyed: x/4\nSaul D'Alessio\n\nDeimos\n\nTime remaining: 12:00\n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\n\n\n=== Cairn the Indomitable ===\nAt the start of the raid, players will pass through a waterfall and be granted the special action skill   Celestial Dash. This mobility skill has a very similar speed and animation to the Druid's   Ancestral Grace. Shortly afterwards, glide over to a circular platform where Cairn the Indomitable awaits. Cairn the Indomitable will only spawn on the platform after a player has talked to Glenna by the entrance of the raid.\n\nHealth: 19,999,998 (19,999,998 if the Challenge Mote is active)\nEnrage Timer: 8 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged — Players cannot cleanse Unseen Burden.\n\n\n==== Core Mechanics ====\n Unseen Burden: Players gain one stack of Unseen Burden every second. Unseen Burden slows player movement by 1% for each stack, up to 99 stacks. You can reduce the number of stacks by successfully navigating the green circle mechanics. (see below) As the fight progresses, normal movement will become almost completely ineffective if these stacks are not removed. However dodges, mobility skills and the   Celestial Dash special skill are unhindered; use these to keep out of danger during the fight.\nSpatial Manipulation: Cairn will periodically charge up and release a devastating Spatial Manipulation attack, damaging and lifting players up into the air while adding 25 stacks of Unseen Burden. To avoid this, green circles will form around the arena which can protect players inside from the attack. Successfully using a green circle will also help players by instead removing 25 stacks of Unseen Burden. Your character will gain  Gaze Avoidance if you have fulfilled the green circle's requirements. There are 3 general patterns of green circles:\nNumbered in Set Positions - Each green circle is in a fixed position and has a number of stars above it (1, 1, 2, 2, 4). The number of stars corresponds to the minimum number of players required to be in the circle such that its protection takes effect. Certain circles will stop spawning depending on which 25% of its health the boss is at. Generally, the majority of players should head for the biggest circle while anyone cursed with Shared Agony can take a small circle for themselves.\nEnergy Surge - Cairn teleports to 5 different, set locations based on the percentage of its health. Standing between his teleport points, which can be detected by seeing a rift of disturbed air or by a directional arrow at his feet, will cause a moderate amount of damage and a long range  Knockback. Above 50%, Cairn will also spawn a guaranteed circle when he lands at the center.\nSword - Green circles will spawn around the arena after Cairn completes its Orbital Sweep attack; there is no minimum on the number of players in a given circle.\nHere are some helpful images to indicate the patterns of green circles:\n\n Shared Agony: Starting at 7:37 and every 20 seconds after that, the furthest player that does not already have it will gain the  Shared Agony debuff, taking 10% of their maximum HP as damage to themselves per tick (~every 3 seconds) and creating a red AoE effect around themselves which deals damage to nearby allies. The debuff lasts for one minute.\nThere can be at most 3 players with the debuff, and once a 4th player gains the debuff, the person who has the debuff the longest loses theirs.\nDowned players don't receive damage from Shared Agony and if the agonized player himself is downed, no one in the circle suffers damage.\nEvery three seconds, the game checks if there are other players in the red circle. The player closest to the agonized player will receive 25% of his max HP as damage. The closest person to Target 1 will then suffer 50% max HP. And the closest person to Target 2 will suffer 75% max HP. All aforementioned players would need to be within the red circle and not already be counted previously for taking damage from that circle. Any other person inside the red circle will suffer no damage at all from Shared Agony.\nPlayers can take damage from multiple Shared Agony circles at once (e.g. 10% of the maximum health from their own circle, and another 50% from being part of a damage chain in another player's circle).\n\n\n==== Overview ====\nA massive jade construct, Cairn is a rather durable foe. The boss fight has no clear phases, although Cairn will gain more dangerous attacks and use them more frequently as its health drops.\n\nCairn's auto-attack, Impact, is to swing with its right arm followed by its left arm in a two-part arc towards the furthest player. Cairn will usually follow up with a Meteor Swarm by swinging its left hand back, throwing a spiraling fan of 9 bloodstone projectiles over a 120° arc at the furthest player; these projectiles will travel to the edge of the platform and knock players back for a short distance. This attack can be dealt with in two different ways, kiting and standing close.\nKiting: One player, typically a druid or another with high self-sustain to tank constant agony, stands near the edge of the platform to always be the target of Meteor Swarm. The projectiles are much easier to avoid and/or block at this far distance.\nClose: Staying within the green and black outlined symbol on the platform allows players to avoid being hit by the projectiles generated from Meteor Swarm. Additionally, if all non-agony players stack in a single location, there is enough room for the three agony players to stand close enough to also avoid being hit by this attack (see image).\nEvery 4 seconds, Cairn will create 3 circles of swirling energy next to it. Once fully charged, players inside will suffer Displacement and be teleported anywhere in the arena within a 1000 unit radius (similar to the Vale Guardian's Unstable Magic Spike/blue circles). The teleport combined with the knockback of Meteor Swarm can easily knock players off the platform, instantly defeating them. Players in melee range of Cairn should make sure they stay off of the circles, and anyone hit should use mobility skills and dodges to get away from the arena's edges. The bloodstone clouds are projectiles, and can be destroyed or converted. Players should be careful not to reflect the projectiles, as they can hit other teammates instead.\nStarting at 7:37 and every 20 seconds after that, the furthest player that does not already have it will gain the  Shared Agony debuff, taking damage over time and creating a red AoE effect around themselves which deals damage to nearby allies. There can be at most 3 players with the debuff, and once a 4th player gains the debuff, the person who has the debuff the longest loses theirs. Afflicted players should try to stay close to healers, while keeping a small distance.\nIn later parts of the fight, Cairn may extend its arm into a sword blade, and shortly afterwards do an Orbital Sweep around the arena; the position of the sword depends on the 25% of health the boss is at, starting from the south and moving counter-clockwise 90°. The initial slam of its arm as a sword blade will knockback any players on its edge, and the Orbital Sweep around the arena will knockback any players hit by it. Since the attack is highly telegraphed, players should take care to dodge the sweep as it passes over them.\nStarting at 25% health or lower, Cairn may also begin to use Gravity Wave after Orbital Sweep, a black tide of energy that ripples outwards and pushes players back towards the arena edges. Players next to Cairn in the middle will be unaffected, but caught players should attempt to dodge back towards the center.\nIf he is not killed in 8 minutes, he becomes  Enraged.  Unseen Burden will no longer be able to be removed or reduced.\n\n\n==== Challenge Mote ====\nIn addition to the above mechanics, players must use   Celestial Dash once every 10 seconds, or else the skill will automatically activate for the maximum range in the direction the player is facing. The timer for doing this is denoted by an effect called  Countdown. Furthermore, when players reach 99 stacks of  Unseen Burden, they will become petrified and lose access to their skills. However, they can still use   Celestial Dash to a green circle to remove stacks.\n\n\n=== Mursaat Overseer ===\nHealth: 22,021,440 (30,000,000 if the Challenge Mote is active)\nEnrage Timer: 6 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged — Increases damage dealt by 200%. No longer able to Claim back tiles.\nAfter defeating Cairn, the miasma below the arena will clear and players are free to walk into the bastion proper. In Death Row, there is a pile of rubble next to the wall with a broken shovel nearby. Heading west will allow you to find a shovel on the ground, and using that on the rubble will open the way into a courtyard, the Recreation Sector that the next encounter takes place in.\nThe fight takes place on a 'game board', with half the space as brown 'friendly' tiles and the other half as orange 'enemy' tiles, which deal 3,500 damage per second to players stepping on them. There are three pillars of light on the friendly side of the arena. Interacting with one of them will give the player a special action key and remove the pillar from the arena. Players can only have one of the pillars of light's effects at a time. Once three separate players interact with them, leaving no pillars of light behind, the fight begins.\nThe players who used the pillars of light at the start will gain a special action skill.\n\n  Dispel removes the orange shield on a Jade Scout or Soldier. This should be used whenever off cooldown on any shielded target, with priority on Scouts/Soldiers directly next to the squad.\n  Claim can retake an orange enemy tile, turning them brown and safe to stand in again. Aiming the claim skill close to the edge of a tile may result in failure, not claiming the tile.\n  Protect creates a circular zone of radius 180 for 5 seconds which turns players invulnerable to damage for the duration that the bubble is up; this includes the spikes, and is the only way to negate them. This skill must be timed well to be helpful, and also has a long cooldown of 180 seconds so it effectively is usable once per fight.\nIf the players holding any of the three skills die during the fight, they will be available for pick-up again after their respective cooldowns. Claim will be available after 8 seconds, Dispel after 18 seconds and Protect after 180 seconds.\n\n\n==== Overview ====\nThe Mursaat Overseer itself is a statue game piece, which simply fixates on the player who took Claim and follows them around. Players will have to deal with the room's various hazards while destroying it.\n\nThe most dangerous mechanic is the spike floor. Patches of the floor will glow slightly with small green spikes. After a delay huge spears will come out, instantly defeating anyone inside (with no downed state). The spikes cannot be avoided by conventional means; the only exception is the Protect skill. These traps follow a sequence of different arrangements, which become more difficult as the boss loses health, with every 25% health threshold changing the pattern (see graphic).\nOn the enemy side of the board, four Jade Scouts (smaller game pieces, or 'pawns') will appear and start moving down across the arena. Occasionally they may also gain an orange shield that makes them invulnerable, until it is removed by Dispel. Any tile that they first move over becomes orange, damaging players that stay on them. Bringing their health to 0 will stop them temporarily, but they will regenerate to full health and start moving to the other side of the board again.\nUpon reaching the other side of the board, the Jade Scouts will transform into active threats. Jade Soldiers will fixate on the player who took Protect and attack the party, deal constant AoE damage around themselves while applying  Poisoned,  Torment, and  Slow, and will explode on death for high damage. They will still claim tiles and gain shields during this time. Since Jade Soldiers claim any tile they move over, if a Soldier will soon arrive at the tile players are on, it is recommended that the player with Claim wait until the tile gets claimed by the Jade Soldier before using Claim on it to turn it friendly again. Once a Soldier is defeated, a Scout will replace it on the far side of the room and begin moving across after some time.\n\n\n==== Challenge Mote ====\n\nThe Mursaat Overseer gains roughly 36% HP compared to the normal mode (30 million instead of 22 million).\nIn addition to the above mechanics, certain sections of the floor will light up blue in a pattern at set intervals of 30 seconds. If players do not stand in these within the 4 seconds they are lit, they die. Additionally, each tile is different from player to player, i.e. client-side. While multiple players can have the same tile pattern, it is unlikely that the whole group will receive the same pattern. There are four possible patterns (as indicated by the adjacent graphic) which always have one blue tile in every row, column, quadrant and the four center tiles. This means that a blue square is (diagonally) adjacent to any possible square a player is standing in and that there is also always a blue field that has no spears in it even though it may be far away.\nBlue patterns are announced every 30 seconds (roughly at x:33/x:03) starting at 5:33 and go off ~4 seconds later (x:29/x:59) which is simultaneous to the spikes in the first phase. Contrary to spikes, their timing is independent on the damage though which means it will be unlikely to have spikes and blues at the same time in the later phases.\nProtection can NOT save people from dying for not standing in a blue field. If spikes coincide perfectly with the blue fields, one can drop the protect bubble on the center of the arena and cover all four middle tiles.\n\n\n=== Samarog ===\nHealth: 29,493,000 (40,000,000 if the Challenge Mote is active)\nEnrage Timer: 11 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged — Deals 500% damage.\nA door will prevent entry into Samarog's arena. Interacting with the door gives players  Gift of True Sight, allowing them to find keys in rubble piles in the rooms nearby. To open the door, 4 players with keys need to interact with door again in no particular order. After the cutscene, approaching Samarog will begin the fight.\nAlternatively, a thief can interact with the door to pick the lock, skipping the search for keys.\n\n\n==== Phase 1 (100% - 66% health) ====\nSamarog's arena is lined with spikes, which instantly kill anyone standing inside them. Many of its attacks will knockback players hit, making it very important to dodge attacks and also take note of positioning.\nSamarog has two primary attacks. It will deal two spear sweeps in quick succession, and getting caught in both can send players flying. It will also use Impaling Stab, lifting up its spears before smashing the ground, dealing extreme damage to anyone on the point. This also releases a shockwave that travels outward, knocking back players hit; the shockwave can be dodged through, but can also be jumped over (similar to Tequatl's waves). The swipe attack is always 180 degrees from the currently fixated person.\nOrange circles will also periodically appear throughout the arena. This indicates Spear Impact will strike there shortly afterwards, which deals damage and leaves a Spear of Aggression or Revulsion at the point which applies conditions to players nearby. The squad should try to keep some sections of the arena clear of these spears.\nWhenever Samarog reaches 10% health intervals, it uses Brutalize, leaping to and disabling the fixated player while it beats them up. The remaining players must break the defiance bar to stop the attack. If the pinned player loses all of their health, or Samarog's defiance bar is not broken within a set time, they are defeated without a downed state. Samarog takes 100% less damage and immune to new conditions being applied to him while his defiance bar is up. Once the bar is broken, the furthest player will become fixated.\n\n\n==== Phase 2 ====\nUpon reaching the 66% health interval, Samarog will become invulnerable and charge into an alcove just outside the spike walls. To make it return, the squad will have to fight both the jotun Guldhem and the human Rigom, both of whom will fixate on different squad members. Guldhem redirects all damage and conditions he takes to Rigom. Once Rigom reaches 1% health, he will use Anguished Wail, which if it hits Samarog will cause Guldhem to become vulnerable to damage for a short time. Rigom will then heal to 100%. Once Guldhem is defeated, Rigom can be killed normally.\nThe difficulty of this phase comes with keeping the two mini-bosses apart. If their orange shields are connecting they will gain buffs over time; Guldhem deals more damage, and Rigom gains more health. To avoid this, and to guarantee the ability to damage Guldhem, it is recommended to use  Knockback and  Immobile, or similar effects, to put Rigom into Samarog's alcove, and keep him there until Guldhem is dead.\n\n\n==== Phase 3 (66% - 33% health) ====\nOnce the mini-bosses are defeated, Samarog will charge back into the arena and resume his previous attacks. However, a new hazard is introduced in Inevitable Betrayal. Periodically, a random player will be surrounded in a large filling orange circle. Another player will gain a small green circle. The green circle player must stand within the center of the orange circle, or that player will take severe damage. The pair should also try and position themselves away from the rest of the squad, as the orange circle will also deal extreme damage to other allies inside it.\nIf there are too many spears in the arena, Samarog will also start recalling them to his location, and the spears deal heavy damage as they travel back to him. Their path will be indicated by arrows on the field.\nSamarog's knockbacks will also increase in strength and cause long duration cripple.\n\n\n==== Phase 4 ====\nUpon reaching 33% health, Samarog will charge back into its alcove and summon Guldhem and Rigom once again. They can be fought in the same method as before. However, Inevitable Betrayal will continue to take effect and players should stay alert.\n\n\n==== Phase 5 (33% - 0% health) ====\nWith the pair defeated again, Samarog will return for its last stand. It gains a new attack, Bludgeon, which has similar animations to the previous shockwave attack but is executed much quicker. Its knockbacks will also become very dangerous, as they increase in distance knocked back[verification requested] and cause  Stun.\nIf the boss is not defeated within 11 minutes, it will gain  Enraged, increasing its damage by 500%.\n\n\n==== Challenge Mote ====\n\nSamarog gains roughly 10 million HP extra over normal mode. (40 million in CM vs 30 million normal)\nThere are no new mechanics to deal with, however existing ones are much more challenging.\nInevitable Betrayal begins from phase 1 of the fight, and now immobilizes the person with the larger AoE. In addition, a spear will spawn on top of the person with the larger AoE when it is fully charged. This means that the person with the smaller circle will need to run to the person with the larger circle. The rest of the group, especially the tank, should try to move away from the aoe and follow the tanking pattern.\nSpear Impact now follows a set pattern, and the Spears it spawns cannot be removed by the players. They will be pulled in by Samarog once all 12 of them are on the field.\nDue to the extra health and slightly advanced mechanics, it is recommended to get Samarog to 66% by approximately 8:30, and finish the phase at 33% by 3:00, to avoid reaching the Enrage phase.\n\n\n=== Deimos ===\nHealth: 35,981,456 (42,000,000 if the Challenge Mote is active)\nEnrage Timer: 12 minutes\nEnrage Effect:  Enraged - Increases damage dealt by 200%.\nPassing through the collapsed walls after Samarog, players will find an isolated floating platform with a Shackled Prisoner on it and deadly miasma below. There is a short staircase on the closest side that players can glide to while waiting to start the encounter, which begins when any player approaches the prisoner. The encounter fails if the prisoner is defeated at any point. Standing near the gargoyles will cause your character to be  Feared towards the center, so be careful.\nIt is recommended that your squad utilize a tank, a hand kiter, and optionally an oil kiter as well. Those 3 will generally stay on the main platform, while the other 7 continue to take green circle teleportation.\n\n\n==== Initial Phase ====\nImages of Greed and Pride will begin walking toward the Shackled Prisoner; if they reach him they will deal damage to him. The images of Greed deal a small amount and the images of Pride deal a large amount of damage. They are vulnerable to soft crowd control which can slow them down as players attack them. After a short delay one player will randomly be marked by an emptying green circle; when it is empty all players standing on it will be teleported to a demonic realm. From there players can break the chains to the north, east, south, and west while Deimos tries to knock them off the platform with a slow hammer swing telegraphed by an orange triangle AoE. While in the demonic realm, players will constantly gain stacks of  ?? which decreases player movement speed with each stack similarly to Unseen Burden. As soon as a chain breaks the players will be teleported back. The phase continues until all four chains are broken, freeing the prisoner. Conditions on the chains will continue to tick damage even after the players have been teleported back to the main platform.\n\n\n==== Second Phase ====\nAfter the chains are broken, Deimos will teleport to the mortal realm to stop the players from assisting Saul. Saul throws a banner that lasts 20 seconds to the squad member furthest away from Deimos. The banner heals everyone within its range for 5% of their maximum HP every second. Saul will also cast  Unnatural Signet (lasts 10 seconds) on Deimos 4 to 5 seconds after he appears, each minute. Deimos periodically uses his Annihilate skill - a powerful knockback that cascades from the front over the sides to the back of himself that cannot be prevented with stability, only with  Aegis, blocking, dodging and invulnerability. Deimos will also periodically cast Soul Feast - up to 5 stacks of grasping hands will gradually spawn in ~1 second intervals underneath the player that is farthest from the boss. If Deimos walks over these grasping hands, he will gain  Devour stacks. It is advised to have a player with channeled blocks and high healing \"kite\" the hands near the edge of the platform. This lets everyone else not worry as much about movement or getting knocked back.\nAt 90% health, Deimos begins to use Mind Crush, a powerful attack that is channeled for 5 seconds before dealing lethal damage to everyone, placing  Weak Minded for 10 seconds on everyone that is hit. This skill can be completely mitigated with the protective bubble from Saul, by blocking it, or by using skills that negate all incoming damage or that prevent lethal damage from downing (such as \"Rebound!\"). Saul casts  Form Up and Advance! on every squad member within his 1,200 unit range for the duration of the Mind Crush channel. Deimos casts Mind Crush every 35-40 seconds.\n\n\n==== Third Phase ====\nStarting at 75% health, Deimos starts placing Demonic Tears on the platform every 15 seconds. These tears shoot bloodstone projectiles every few seconds. A squad member can walk over its white effect circle to close it, gaining  Tear Instability for 1 minute, which prevents closing another demonic tear for the duration. The affected player will also have a  skull above their head, not visible to other players.\nAt 75%, one player (except the tank or hand-kiter) will randomly be marked by an emptying green circle that teleports everyone standing in it to the demonic realm. This time, a copy of Saul with the ability text \"Thief\" will appear in the middle of the platform. This copy channels a skill that steals all boons from the squad if its cc bar is not broken by the players. He will try to channel this multiple times, so try not to burn every cc skill on the initial cast. When the copy of Saul reaches 50% health, everyone within the demonic realm, including the copy of Saul, will be teleported back to the main platform. With that, the grasping hands now start moving towards Deimos, but disappear after 5 seconds.\nAt 60% health, Deimos starts using Rapid Decay (Also known as oil/black circles), an AoE field that is telegraphed 3 seconds as an orange effect field. Rapid Decay deals damage and expands its radius every time someone is hit by its effect until ~80% of the platform is covered. Deimos uses Rapid Decay every 15 seconds and the fields disappear after 30 seconds. Deimos targets the squad member closest to the boss, excluding the tank. A player can be assigned to kite this mechanic away from the middle where Saul casts the bubble for Mind Crush.\n\n\n==== Fourth Phase ====\nWhen Deimos reaches 50% health, one player (except the tank or hand-kiter) will randomly be marked by an emptying green circle that again teleports everyone standing in it to the demonic realm. This time, a copy of Saul with the ability text \"Gambler\" will appear. It will periodically disappear and summon 3 clones, placed in direction of the previously destroyed chains. The squad members need to defeat the \"real\" copy of Saul, which can be identified by what weapon he is wielding: clones wield Prisoner's Treasured Bough, while the non-clone wields Staff of Matthias. When the copy of Saul reaches 50% health, everyone within the demonic realm, including the copy of Saul, will be teleported back to the main platform. The copy of Saul aggros on a player, presumably the one with the highest precision (see details in the discussion page). The grasping hands start moving towards Deimos, but disappear after 5 seconds.\nAt 40% health, the images of Greed and Pride from the initial phase start appearing again and walk towards Saul. They explode upon reaching Saul, dealing 2% and 25% of the maximum HP respectively to Saul and anybody in the vicinity.\n\n\n==== Fifth Phase ====\nWhen Deimos reaches 25% health, one player (except the tank or hand-kiter) will randomly be marked by an emptying green circle that teleports everyone standing in it to the demonic realm. This time, a copy of Saul with the ability text \"Drunkard\" will appear. It will periodically teleport players on the platform around if its cc bar is not broken. The time frame to break him in this phase is considerably smaller than his \"Thief\" phase. When the copy of Saul reaches 50% health, everyone within the demonic realm, including the copy of Saul, will be teleported back to the main platform. The grasping hands start moving towards Deimos, but disappear after 5 seconds.\n\n\n==== Final Phase ====\nAt 10% health, Deimos becomes invulnerable and teleports everyone to the demonic realm. Deimos now appears as a world boss/structure at the side of the platform. He no longer uses Annihilate and Mind Crush, but he will continue creating hands and Rapid Decay (oil) circles as before. He begins using an auto-attack chain of slamming the ground starting with either the right or with the left fist, then the other fist, then both. Each of the slams will knockback nearby players away unless blocked or with  Aegis or  Stability, the singular slams will affect their respective side of the arena, and the slam with both hands the middle part. Once Deimos is defeated, players and Saul will be teleported back to the Solitary Confinement platform and the prison will be cleared of miasma, allowing further exploration and investigation of the area.\n\n\n==== Challenge Mote ====\nDeimos gains roughly 6 million HP over normal mode (42 million CM vs 36 million normal).\nSaul is no longer a part of the fight and cannot help, therefore the following must be dealt with:\nSaul will not create his ward in the center and thus Mind Crush must be blocked by other means such as Aegis.\nSince Saul remains trapped, he cannot be healed, so it is vital to kill as many Prides and Greeds as possible before they can damage him.\nUnnatural Signet will not be cast on Deimos, so overall damage dealt by the squad will be lower.\nThe healing banner will not be placed on the squad member furthest away from Deimos, so the hand kiter must be prepared for extra pressure.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAnimals\nFrog\nRat\nAsura\nScholar Glenna\nHuman\nSaul D'Alessio\nInsect\nBeetle\nBug Swarm\nMosquito\nSpider\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nJade Construct\nCairn the Indomitable (boss)\nJade Scout\nJade Soldier\nMursaat Overseer (boss)\nDemon\nDeimos (boss)\nHuman\nRigom\nJotun\nGuldhem\nUnknown\nSamarog (boss)\n\n\n== Objects ==\nAnvil\nBody\nBroken Shovel\nCorpse\nChallenge Mote\nClothes Pile\nCrumpled Note\nDagger\nDemonic Bond\nDirt Pile\nFire Pit\nFood Platter\nFood Stash\nFour Hidden chests\nJotun Corpse\nJournal\nJournal Page\nLey Rift\nLocket\nOpen Book\nPrison Cell\nPyramid\nRack\nShovel\nSpear of Aggression\nSpear of Revulsion\nSpeared Corpse\nStrange Book\nStrange Object\nStrange Object\nTattered Book\nTorture Chair\nTree\nUrn\n\n\n== Dialogue ==\n\nUpon approaching Glenna:\n\nScholar Glenna: There you are! Now that you're here, we can explore this place.\n<Character name>: I see someone's a bit impatient. You think there's something important here?\nScholar Glenna: Isn't it obvious? I make a discovery, I'm going to investigate the heck out of it.\nScholar Glenna: And wait 'til you see what I found.\n<Character name>: Where exactly are we?\nScholar Glenna: Good question!

Humans, jotun... Who else is being kept here?\nIf charr:\n<Character name>: (snort) Jotun and humans... who else did they lock up in this place?\nIf human:\n<Character name>: Whoever ran this prison made some enemies. If humans and jotun were locked up, who else did they jail?\nIf sylvari:\n<Character name>: So many lives cut short. I wonder... if they imprisoned humans and jotun here, who else did they incarcerate?\nIf norn:\n<Character name>:If they imprisoned humans and jotun, who else did they hold here?\nAfter interacting with the Clothes Pile:\n\nIf asura:\n<Character name>: These clothes wouldn't fit a bipedal individual.

Join the others? There's no more room.\nAfter interacting with the Speared Corpse in the Warden's Office:\n\nIf charr:\n<Character name>: (sniff) He's been dead a long time, yet there's little decay.\nIf human:\n<Character name>: The body is strangely preserved. Under normal conditions, he'd be a pile of bones by now.\nIf sylvari:\n<Character name>: Curious. The elements haven't reclaimed his body. It's as if he's been preserved somehow.\nIf norn:\n<Character name>: He didn't die recently, yet the corpse defies decomposition.\nIf asura:\n<Character name>: This corpse is anything but fresh, yet it gives off very little odor. Like it's been preserved.\nDeimos\nUpon approaching the Shackled Prisoner:\n\nShackled Prisoner: What are you doing? You'll let him out!\nDeimos: The Eye has chosen its sacrifice!\nUpon freeing Saul D'Alessio:\n\nSaul D'Alessio: I'd rather die than remain here any longer.

I was caught for my crimes and exiled.\nSaul D'Alession: I was left for dead. Until the mursaat found me.\nWhen Deimos has 10% health left:\n\nDeimos: You will die where and when I decide!\nDeimos: You will be consumed!\nDeimos: Your soul will never rest! Your name will forever be poison on the lips of your people!\nSaul D'Alessio: You have no power over me!\nDeimos: (demonic laughter)\nCinematic upon defeating Deimos:\n\nSaul D'Alessio: It's all my fault.\nSaul D'Alessio: The mursaat betrayed us and murdered my men, and then dragged me to this terrible place.\nSaul D'Alessio: I've been trapped here, tormented by my own demons—paralyzed by the shame of selling out my people.\nSaul D'Alessio: The Eye kept me alive and used my guilt to try to break me down, force me to be the mursaat's puppet.\nSaul D'Alessio: Now I'm free.\nAfter interacting with the Food Platter:\n\n<Character name>: Hm.\nAfter interacting with the Urn:\n\n<Character name>: I guess not all of the prisoners were intended for release.\nAfter interacting with the Fire Pit:\n\n<Character name>: I don't want to know what those hooks are for.\nAfter interacting with the Torture Chair:\n\nIf charr:\n<Character name>: I can see how this'd make someone talk.\nIf human:\n<Character name>: The mursaat's cruelty knows no bounds.\nIf sylvari:\n<Character name>: I wonder how many prisoners broke under duress.\nIf norn:\n<Character name>:A confessional tool for cowards.

They're even worse than the charr.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe raid wing was first announced by an article on massivelyOP.\nThis raid is a single wing, and will not be expanded in the future. \n\n\n== Trivia ==\nBobby Stein was the Lead Narrative Designer for the Guild Wars 2 Raids Team at the time of this wing's release.\nThe instance was originally themed around a tomb, not a prison. \nOne iteration of the tomb idea had an entire room of statues that would come to life, evoking a similar visual to the terra-cotta army of Qin Shi Huang. \nThere are 1,222 spears in the map, for a total of 1.1 million triangles in spears alone! \nOriginally, there was no cinematic to introduce the shackled prisoner encounter—the cinematics team saw the model and asked [the raid development team] if they could make one. \nThe initial concept for the final boss involved players fighting the shackled prisoner, but the [raid development] team felt it would be more interesting to humanize that character and instead fight the fearsome demon that imprisoned him. \n\n\n== See also ==\n Bastion of the Penitent\n\n\n== References ==",

Once through the gate, you will end up at Rata Novus where Kasmeer will meet you. Walk with her until you reach the main lab where several dragon minion experiments have escaped. Defeat the five of them and talk to Taimi who's standing in front of her Omadd's machine. Once Phlunt intrudes, talk to him and choose any of the dialogue options. Regardless of your choice, Phlunt leaves the scene; shortly after, a distressed Marjory will approach you, warning you that Lazarus will be arriving shortly.\nIn order to break Lazarus's illusion, you have to collect and mount three Holorecorder Mirrors around the room — you may only carry one mirror at a time. You will need to use gliding and jump off the stairway platforms to reach two of the mirrors. The locations of the mirrors and the stands are marked on the minimap.  Once all three have been collected, open the secret Dragon Lab door via the Rata Novus Terminal controls. To successfully open them choose /access, /continue, /continue, and then \"Aurene\". If done in correct order, the large dragon door will open, and Lazarus will suddenly appear. The previously set mirrors will harm Lazarus, but only for a short while — you will have to defend the Repair Drone as it repairs each of the three mirrors — Lazarus will attack you with several illusions as well as his hired mercenaries. The Repair Drone has very low health, so you'll have to defeat nearby enemies for it to survive long enough to complete its task; use crowd control skills on his mercenaries and illusions to keep them from hurting the golem. Additionally, you may use the consoles in front of each of the dragon minion experiments to open them up and have them help in the fight and also the console at the bottom of ramp leading to Taimi's experiment to active Phlunt's golems (the password is 'Password').\nAfter all three mirrors have been fixed, walk near the machine to lure Lazarus back into the mirror beams, but avoid standing in the beams yourself. The mirror beams will remove Lazarus's protective shield, allowing you to damage him. He begins using more powerful abilities that deal high amounts of damage, including an especially powerful Ring of Fire that deals devastating damage even when standing inside the ring. However, you only have to bring Lazarus from 75% to 25% of his health. Turning invulnerable, Lazarus will destroy the machine, revealing his true identity. He will disappear, while dozens of his mercenaries will come down the staircase from the asura gate. You must defeat almost all of them to continue, but they have low health and Councillor Phlunt and Peacemaker Officers will help you in the fight. After disposing of them, approach Marjory and Kasmeer, and then talk to Taimi. After a short dialogue, the story will conclude.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\n\nComplete the instance.\n\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Born for Battle effect.\n\nEasiest accomplished at the end of the episode after all the objectives have been completed. Climb the stairs in the middle of the room and use the updrafts to reach the three sprinklers located in the upper section of the room.\nAfter ascending to the top of the south stairs, the Emergency Sprinklers can be found straight ahead of you (a little south of east), directly to your right (a little west of south), and in between the two. All three are about the level of the second highest platform in the stairs or above.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  Fire Fighter effect.\n\nAvoid getting hit by Lazarus' red AoE circle.\nAchievement qualification may be tracked via the  It Burns, Burns, Burns... effect.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nAsura\nCouncillor Phlunt\nMedic\nPeacemaker Officer\nResearcher\nTaimi\nVeteran Peacemaker Officer\nWyndall [sic]\nWorker\nHumans\nLady Kasmeer Meade\nMarjory Delaqua\nHolograms\nHolographic Bait\nGolems\nPH1NT 1.0\nPH1NT 2.0\nR.N.F.D.

I have a bone to pick with you...\n<Character name>: Before I get an earful, I told Marjory it was a terrible idea.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Marjory's her own person. If anyone knows that...\n<Character name>: A refreshing dose of rationality. I missed you.\n<Character name>: So. This bone that needs picking...\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Did my invite to Dragon's Watch get lost in the mail?\n<Character name>: Well, there was the matter of the bloodstone exploding... And Lazarus...\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Flimsy excuses. But...I'm in. If you'll have me.\n<Character name>: Absolutely. Have you heard from Marjory?\nLady Kasmeer Meade: No. But she'll check in when she can. She always does.\n<Character name>: Why do you think she went with him in the first place?\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Who knows what goes on in that beautiful head of hers?\n<Character name>: Hm. Looks like Taimi's just about ready!\nApproaching the laboratory main area:\n\nWorker: Watch it! Watch it! She's rearing up!\nWorker: I told you this was a three-asura job!\nWorker: She's loose! It's going to be a two-asura funeral!\nTaimi: Watch it! Dragon minions liberated! They're all out!\nVarious comments by the numerous asura workers in the area\nWorker: Oh my stars! The containment fields are failing! Taimi, Taimi, Taimi!\nWorker: I warned them. But did they listen? Nooooo.

I don't have my deck of \"Heroes of Tyria\" flash cards handy.\nSpeaking to Taimi:\n\nTaimi: Hi! Hi! Thanks for the help. How do you like my new toy?\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Taimi, this is amazing. I think. What's it do?\nTaimi: I don't want to get too technical on you, so: machine make dragons go (death sound).\n(Taimi flops down on her behind)\nLady Kasmeer Meade: I think I can handle a bit more detail.\nTaimi: Great! First, that quarter-inch unit there is a thermogulator. Thermog coming from the asura root word for—\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Little less.\nTaimi: Ah. Okay, it runs off the heart of Omadd's Machine.\nTaimi: That, combined with my spectrum research, aided by my assistant, Spencer...\nTaimi: Will let me manipulate the Eternal Alchemy to smash Primordus and Jormag's unique signatures together.\nTaimi: Thus, cancelling them out. I.E. dragons go (death sound).\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Remarkable.\nTaimi: Isn't it? For the experiment, I've brought minions from the dragons to see if I can do it on a micro scale.\nTaimi: You just met them.\n<Character name>: When do we get to see it in action?\nTaimi: As soon as I can convince these other asura to leave. I'm not exactly sure what'll happen when I kick it on.\nTaimi: It'll likely work as intended, but could also blow this place sky high.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Let's clear the area, then.\nTaimi: Well, there's a problem with that...\nCouncillor Phlunt: Hello, progeny. And how are we ruining science today?\nTaimi: You know, one of these days you'll admit how valuable I am. You'll see!\nCouncillor Phlunt: Improbable. This thing is looking less and less like a \"coolerator\" and more and more like...\nCouncillor Phlunt: Like...a monstrosity designed to go down in the annals of failed inventions!\nTaimi: Councillor Phlunt, I assure you, it will revolutionize elixir-cooling technology! I mean, who wants tepid elixirs?\nTaimi: So, if you'll kindly remove yourself and your flunkies, er, assistants from my lab...\nCouncillor Phlunt: To enable you to freely plunder all the research we leave behind? I think not!\nTaimi: Uh, Commander. Maybe you could reason with (punch) the esteemed (not esteemed) councillor here?\nSpeaking to Councillor Phlunt:\n\nCouncillor Phlunt: Doing Taimi's dirty work for her, huh? Out with it!\n The dirty work'll be scraping your pieces off the walls if you don't leave.\nYour brash assaults will get you nowhere.\n Grrrr.\n Merely trying to help out a friend. You should try it sometime. By leaving. (Same response as ferocity above)\n The situation is dangerous. Consider it: evacuation is the wisest route.\nOn the contrary; protecting my research at any cost is the wisest route!\n But wouldn't you say that Taimi is an untested talent?\nUntested is a polite way to say it. She's reckless and clearly second fiddle in the realm of intellect. Maybe even third or fourth!\n A fine point from the first fiddle. Move out, before I de-string you.\nPlease. I'm very busy and you're bothering me. And your breath is quite objectionable.\n Grrr.\n Don't you agree that the likelihood of her destroying the lab is very high?\nHmmm. You're smarter than you look. And you look awful. Take this passcode. When the time is right, have those golems carry my inverse magniscope upstairs.\n Thanks?\n There's something I want to show you outside. (Same response as ferocity above)\n And what masterful research it is! The outside world needs your brilliance!\nNice try, genius.\n Grrr.\n The cost will be your face. (Same response as charisma above)\n(Phlunt leaves after using ferocity or charisma options)\nCouncillor Phlunt: Your elementary attempts at persuasion sadden me. No wonder you were kicked out of the Pact.\n(Phlunt leaves after using dignity options)\nCouncillor Phlunt: Okay, everyone, secure your research and start heading through the gate!\nCouncillor Phlunt: Field experiments for the rest of the day! Don't forget your antichak armaments!\nInteracting with Golem Control Panel:\n\nGolem Control Panel:Welcome to the Golem Control System, Councilor Phlunt. Please enter your password.\n I don't have it.\nIf obtained the password from Phlunt\n The password is... \"Password.\"\nSpeaking with the powered golem:\n\nPH1NT 1.0/PH1NT 2.0: Greetings, Councillor—Phlunt. You—are—measuring—unusually—tall—and—healthy—today. Is—it—time—to—get—to—work?\n Not just yet. Stand by and prepare to enter combat mode.\nVarious chatter from the asura in the portal area:\n\nWorker: What's going on?\nWorker: Are we in danger?\nWorker: I have to leave my research behind? What?\nWorker: What's happening?\nWorker: What's Taimi done now?\nResearcher: Did I hear them mention a Lazarus? Wasn't that the name of a mursaat?\nTalking to Marjory:\n\nMarjory Delaqua: Commander!\n<Character name>: You made it!\nMarjory Delaqua: Barely. Hi, Kas. My leaving didn't go unnoticed. He's probably only a few minutes behind me.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Lazarus, or whoever, is coming here? What should we... How should we prepare?\n<Character name>: Did you get any intel while you were with him?\nMarjory Delaqua: Plenty—he's raising an army of hired mercenaries. He has a base being built in the Fire Islands.\nMarjory Delaqua: All under the guise of battling dragons, but...nothing that seems relevant to a personal weakness.\nMarjory Delaqua: Although...there was a mirror, like a hand mirror, he kept very close.\nMarjory Delaqua: I wanted a better look at it, but it never left his side.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Maybe that's what he's using to disguise himself. Mirrors have a long history with mesmer illusions.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: If we break the illusion, at the very least we'll know who we're dealing with.\nMarjory Delaqua: How?\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Magic mirrors don't like their own reflections; it runs counter to their spells.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: If we can catch him in a few enchanted mirrors of our own, it might shatter the illusion.\nTaimi: And if it doesn't?\nLady Kasmeer Meade: He'll get to see himself murder us from various different angles?\nTaimi: You pick now to get a sense of humor?\nTaimi: I like it! I set up reflector disks around the lab to get the lighting just right to record my historic experiment. We could use those as mirrors!\nLady Kasmeer Meade: I'll enchant them. Once the illusion is broken, I can tie him up tight with magic.\nTaimi: Commander, you grab 'em and position them in the right places. There, there, and there should work. We'll work on getting these folks out of here.\nPersonal conversation between Marjory and Kasmeer:\n\nMarjory Delaqua: How've you been? I heard you missed the fun in Divinity's Reach...\nLady Kasmeer Meade: The countess had me observing interrogations, ministers and White Mantle, detecting lies.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: So...Camp Lazarus. Did you find what you were looking for?\nMarjory Delaqua: We made friendship bracelets!\nLady Kasmeer Meade: You'll note I'm not laughing.\nMarjory Delaqua: Is that because it was a bad joke, or... Okay, I... I wasn't looking for anything in particular... I just—\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Next time maybe consult your girlfriend before throwing yourself in the lion's den.\nMarjory Delaqua: The commander tried to stop me too. Didn't work out so well.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: This isn't about permission. You're your own person. But you're also on a team.\nMarjory Delaqua: Dragon's Watch got along just fine without me.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: I was talking about the team you and I are on.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Maybe I would have gone with you, maybe I would have stayed. But I never got to make that choice.\nMarjory Delaqua: Look, I get it, but an opportunity like that... You don't just say \"hold on a second\" and write a mail.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Taimi has communicators.\nMarjory Delaqua: You know what I mean.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: (sigh) I'm glad you're back, though.\nMarjory Delaqua: Me too.\nAfter mounting the third Holorecorder Mirror:\n\n<Character name>: Taimi. Done! Now what?\nTaimi: We just need to...\nCouncillor Phlunt: Progeny! What did your defective machine do to the gate? It's broken!\nTaimi: It's not my— What do you mean? The gate's down?\nCouncillor Phlunt: Am I not being clear? We couldn't leave if we wanted to or not!\nMarjory Delaqua: He's trapped us here.\n<Character name>: Taimi, we have to get these people out to safety.\nTaimi: But there's no other way ou— You don't mean...? You DO mean... But... (sigh) Fine. Open it. There's a hidden panel right there.\nTaimi: The password is our new dragon friend's name.\nAccess the Rata Novus Terminal on the east side of the room:\n\nRate Novus Terminal: Welcome to the Rata Novus Automated Custodial System.

What's happening? There's a whole lab back here with a functioning gate!\nTaimi: Everyone go through it! But don't look around too much on your way!\nCouncillor Phlunt: PROGENY!\nTaimi: I'm as surprised as you! Who knew the commander had a secret lab!\nTaimi: But importantly: mortal danger. You gotta go. A mursaat/not-a-mursaat, on the way...\nCouncillor Phlunt: Oh, yes! Surely you're telling the truth now! I'm certainly not leaving! No one is! I mean it. Wyndall, put that down.\nLazarus: Ah, Marjory, there you are. I'd grown used to your ever-so-pleasant company.\nCouncillor Phlunt: Actually, I could use a stretch. Let's go, everyone!\nWorker: I can't believe I didn't notice that was a door.\nTalking to Lazarus:\n\n<Character name>: Lazarus, I don't recall inviting you here. I suggest you leave.\nLazarus: But my friends and I just arrived.\n<Character name>: Through a gate that was moments ago not letting anyone out...\nLazarus: I'd heard there was a machine here. A machine that could kill two Elder Dragons with one blow.\nLazarus: I just had to see it for myself. And, I was a little disappointed you didn't let me know about it.\nLazarus: In the name of camaraderie and strategic alignment.\n<Character name>: You're right. Be my guest. It's right over there.\nTaimi: Commander! (Oh, yeah.)\nLazarus: AH! What is this?\n<Character name>: I know you're an imposter! Show yourself!\nLazarus: Fools! Destroy the mirrors!\nLazarus: ARRRRGH!\n<Character name>: The charade ends here!\nTaimi: Lazarus's illusions broke our mirrors. So many years of bad luck! Get rid of them, and I'll call my repair drones.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: I can't cage him until the illusion is broken! He needs to be reflected in all three!\nTaimi: Got a crazy idea: let's see how he likes some minions on his heels!\nTaimi: Drones primed! Let's get those mirrors back up ASAP!\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Lure him back to where he's reflected in all the mirrors at once!\nLazarus: ARRRRGH!\nLazarus: Enough of this!\nLazarus moves towards the machine (cinematic):\n\nKasmeer Meade: The illusion is broken! Now I can...\nKasmeer Meade: (gasp) Balthazar!\nAfter the cinematic:\n\nBalthazar: I will have this machine.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: He's...one of the Six! (hic)\nBalthazar: And you will burn.\nBalthazar: Starting with you, my bothersome shadow!\nMarjory Delaqua: Uggh!\nTaimi: Marjory!\nLady Kasmeer Meade: No!\nBalthazar: See that no one lives. This tires me, and the dragons call.\n<Character name>: Get Marjory some help! I'll hold them off as long as I can.\nTaimi: Okay, but...so many of them... Commander, maybe it's time to retreat?\nCouncillor Phlunt: No one retreats while Phlunt still phights! You can't aurally hear what I did, but it's very clever!\nTaimi: He came back? You came back! You DO value me!\nCouncillor Phlunt: All hands, SAVE MY RESEARCH!\nTaimi: Well... I walked into that.\nCouncillor Phlunt: Front lines, form a body shield around my experiment station!\nCouncillor Phlunt: Sacrifice yourself for superior knowledge! Everyone else in first—I'll bring up the rear.\nOnce the fight is finished:\n\nTaimi: That looks like all of them. Lab's clear.\nChecking on Marjory:\n\nLady Kasmeer Meade: Jory... Is she okay? (hic)\nMedic: This human is stabilized. She'll likely survive. I suppose.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: I'm sorry. I froze. It was Balthazar. The god... (hic)\nMarjory Delaqua: You...\nMedic: Ah! Heart-rate spike! This situation is stressing the human. Please vacate. Shoo!\nTaimi: The medics will take care of her. She probably just needs to be... Maybe...maybe we just go over here for a second?\nTalking to Taimi:\n\nLady Kasmeer Meade: I hesitated... I—\nTaimi: Could it really be Balthazar?\nLady Kasmeer Meade: It is. He dropped the lie. (hic)\nLady Kasmeer Meade: And his mirror. It was special—enchanted by Lyssa herself.\nTaimi: And now he has my machine! What are your gods doing, Kasmeer?\n<Character name>: To what end, I don't know, but we can't just allow it—we have to stop him.\nLady Kasmeer Meade: I'm sorry. I can't do this. I'll... I'm sorry, Commander. Tell Marjory... (hic) I love her.\nTaimi: Okay, bye, I guess... This is beyond crazy. To recap, you picked a fight with a god. The God of War.\n<Character name>: Thanks, Taimi.\nTaimi: Why do you think... What should we do now?\n<Character name>: The deception, the lies, the willingness to kill to get what he wants.\n<Character name>: God or not, my instincts say whatever he's up to can't be beneficial.\nTaimi: Marjory mentioned a base on Fire Islands. If he wants to absorb a dragon's power, that'd be the place to do it.\nTaimi: Right on top of Primordus. And, if I remember correctly, he's also the God of Fire, so... Primordus over Jormag.\n<Character name>: Then that's where I start.\nTaimi: Thankfully, I put a tracker on my machine to prevent \"Phlunting.\"\nTaimi: I'll send an assistant to help you find it. Head to Rata Sum. I'll line up transportation from there to the islands.\nTaimi: While you do that, I'm going to lock myself in the simulation room to run a test on a new theory I want to investigate.\n<Character name>: And avoid Phlunt?\nTaimi: Always. Stay safe, Commander! This is uncharted ground. I'll be in touch!\nSpeaking with the Medic:\n\nMedic: She's still in a volatile state. Back away, please.\nMedic: I don't care if you're the commander, or... I don't know what's higher than a commander...\nTaimi: Poobah!\nMedic: Sure, that.\nEntering the Dragon Lab:\n\nWorker: What just happened?\nWorker: I think that was one of the Mist beings worshiped by humans. Maybe?\nResearcher: Balthazar, God of War. I did my Racial Studies thesis on him. Never thought I'd get a chance to see him!\nWorker: He took Taimi's device. What's she going to do now?\nWorker: I'm just glad we survived the encounter.\nSpeaking with other allies and objects:\n\nTaimi: Well, isn't this an epoxy pot of trouble. I've never seen Kasmeer so...upset. If you'd asked me yesterday, I'd have said there was a 6.3% chance Lazarus was Balthazar. Just goes to show...\n Goes to show what?\nI can still be surprised. So what's our next step? He's got my machine. We could just let him do his worst with the dragons? Save us the trouble.\n I'm not inclined to trade one problem for another.\nYou're thinking about how he absorbed all that magic from the bloodstone, hm? I've been thinking about that too. Why does he need all that power? Is he sick?\n(if human)\n Someone once told me it was impossible to look upon the gods.\nAnother data point to support that Balthazar isn't as powerful as he once was. It could be the frequency of his glowy godness has been reduced. (continues with \"He's not as powerful...\")\n(otherwise)\n He's not as powerful as the legends made me expect.\nI need time. None of this adds up, and I'm starting to get an uneasy feeling. I've got a few avenues of theory to explore.\n I'm going after him. We need to know what he's up to. We'll talk soon.\nMarjory Delaqua: She just left? She left me... Made a portal and went? Just like that.\n Kas was very upset, Jory. In shock.\nI almost died because she...froze.\n But you didn't, so just focus on getting better. I have to go after him.\nI've never had faith in the gods the way Kas does. She still prays to them. I...I haven't since I was a child—never felt them close to me. I can't... Did we really just come face-to-face with a god?\n(if human)\n Yes. We did. It was definitely Balthazar. But...something's not right.\n(otherwise)\n Depends on how you define \"god.\" But...something wasn't right.\nWhy didn't he just kill us outright? I mean...he's a god! We almost had him. If Kas hadn't... But, he's a god! He should have wiped us all out with a thought.\n(if human)\n I don't understand either. His power wasn't what I'd expected of a god.\n(otherwise)\n Maybe. His power wasn't what I'd expect from a being with his reputation.\nNeedless to say, I won't be getting after him anymore. That maybe wasn't the best decision on my part, though I did get some helpful information.\n About that, do you know where the White Mantle stand?\nThe White Mantle? You probably noticed that there weren't any with Lazarus—I mean Balthazar—when he showed up. It's because he cut ties with them. I should have paid more attention to that.\n Cut ties? What does that mean?\nI think he killed a bunch of them. I heard him say something about them turning on him? I didn't understand it at the time, but I suppose if they found out who he was, their heads would've exploded.\n He probably knew he was about to be exposed.\nYeah, that makes sense. Their usefulness came to an end. It seems, at long last, that the White Mantle are done. Unless the real Lazarus is still out there.\n That's the last thing we need. Let's focus on the troubles we can see, OK?\nWhat are you going to do now?\n I'm going to track him using Taimi's device and find out what he's doing.\nBe careful. The gods are mysterious. They don't think like we do. A god. I suppose I should go after Kas, but... She chose him...over me.\n Get some rest. This shook us all up. I'll talk to you soon.\n I'd better get going. Take care of yourself.\n I better get after him. My ride's waiting.\n I should run. You take care of yourself.\n Yeah. She wasn't thinking. I have to go. See you soon.\nBroken Mirror: Balthazar's mirror lies shattered and sapped of its magic.\n Examine it more closely.\n(if human mesmer)\nThe markings on it identify it as powerful mesmer magic. The design contains Lyssa's signature sigils, indicating that it was hers. She must have helped Balthazar for some reason known only to her.\n(if human non-mesmer)\nThe decorative elements on it resemble those you've seen used by mesmers, and those are Lyssa's symbols around the edge. This was definitely god magic, thought now it's broken and has no magic left.\n(if non-human mesmer)\nThe markings on it indicate it was powerful mesmer magic unlike any you've ever seen. Now that it's broken, it won't work ever again. It's trash.\n(otherwise)\nThe decorative elements on it look like those you've seen used by mesmers. Whoever made it was a master craftsman. It's dead and useless now, though still beautiful.\n Leave it for Taimi to destroy. (Taimi picks up the mirror)\nCouncillor Phlunt: Astounding! It never ceases to amaze me how that annoying little genius manages to put one over on me. Your lab, indeed. Does she think I'm stupid as well as blind?\n(if asura)\n Don't be daft. It is mine. Taimi is working under my tutelage.\nUnder your... Hmph! I suppose you do walk the cutting edge of dragon research.\n And Taimi is my primary researcher, under my protection. Don't forget that.\n(otherwise)\n She has many words she uses to describe you.\n\n\n== My story ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nRata Novus is accessed via Rata Sum for the purposes of this mission.\nStanding inside the confinement area will kick out the character from the force field once it gets activated.\nOnce the dragon minions have all been subdued, they are lured back into the confinement areas with \"holographic bait\" in the form of a pig.\nBalthazar's mercenaries are considered pirates.",

It is a hollow volcanic island on the northwest edge of the island chain, submerged until being forced to the surface by the Elder Dragon Primordus tunnelling underneath. The druids have long watched over this area, having created a nature sanctuary when the island was still beneath the waves; in 1173 AE, the few survivors of the chak attack on Rata Novus fled here, to a colony still in development called Rata Arcanum. Zinn created a device to terraform the area for the benefit of Rata Arcanum, but the druids reacted violently and slaughtered them all. The colony has since been reappropriated by the Inquest.\nPerhaps due to Primordus' corrupting presence below, the Sulphuric Water that floods the lower levels of the cavern is acidic and boils fiercely, and will quickly kill the unwary swimmer.\nRecently, Balthazar had brought the White Mantle to the area under the guise of Lazarus, then later mercenaries to build a fortress to combat Primordus.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nLike most of the Living World Season 3 zones, Draconis Mons is not directly connected to neighboring areas.

Ancient Hollow is primarily reached from above.\nTop floor - Split into another two heart areas: Heathen's Hold (#3, to the northeast), and Rata Arcanum (#4, to the west).

      "strWikiText": "Arborstone or the Cathedral zu Heltzer (named after Count zu Heltzer) is located within the Echovald Forest and many years ago was the home of the Kurzicks serving as a great city. It now serves as a hub for the Kestrels.\nThe zone starts fairly bare, but the Arborstone Revitalization mastery track allows the player to build out this base in a similar fashion to the Eye of the North, unlocking new interactions, services and collections.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nUse the   Arborstone Portal Scroll, rewarded by the Fallout story step, which can be used by any character (at level 80) to quickly travel there, with unlimited uses.\nThere is a portal from New Kaineng City in the lower right corner of the map, at the very back of the Petrified Woods.\nThere is a portal from the Echovald Wilds.\nThere is an asura gate in Lion's Arch at Coriolis Plaza, on the higher level of asura gates.\n\n\n== Unlocking ==\nArborstone is unlocked upon completion of the Fallout story step.\nYou only have to do this once to unlock Arborstone for all characters on your account.\nEach completed Mastery in the Arborstone Revitalization mastery track adds new NPCs and/or structures to the area.\n\nEmpty or The Cycle, Reborn story[verification requested]: Gives access to Club Canach, you can get there though a cave near the fishing merchants.\nBase of Operations: Adds the Fishmonger, Fishing Supplies merchant and an asura gate to Lion's Arch.\nCrafting Center: Unlocks Crafting stations for all professions on the upper level.\nEntertaining Amenities: Gives access to a gladiator arena (PvP).\nCommercial Hub: Adds Bank, Guild Bank, Trading Post and Mystic Forge along with some vendors.\nGlobalization: Adds the Legendary Crafting Merchant Leivas and unlocks the ability to purchase Antique Summoning Stones from him.\n\n\n== History ==\nArborstone was the home of the Kurzicks serving the House zu Heltzer, it grew so large that it became a city, to the point that the Council of Nobles decided that the entire area should have an official name. Count zu Heltzer predictably suggested that the area be named Cathedral zu Heltzer, but the other Nobles of the House did not agree, and the name Arborstone won the final vote.\nAt one point, the structure was guarded to keep out Wardens and other creatures of the Echovald Forest, but these protective magics decayed over time, so the forest dwellers took over, forcing the Kurzicks to leave. The Urn of Saint Viktor used to be displayed in the northwest section of the cathedral proper.\n\n\n== Related masteries ==\n\n\n== Locations and objectives ==\nWaypoints\n Arborstone Waypoint — \n

Not one bit.\nKestrel Flockheart: Me neither. Ayumi's compromising everything we've built.\nKestrel Zuru: That child has no appreciation for our legacy. Viri never should have brought her into our ranks.\nKestrel Flockheart: Viri was the best of us. His niece is not.\nKestrel Zuru: This is a place of refuge. Not a...den of iniquity!\nKestrel Zuru: I'm glad Viri isn't alive to see his niece drag our good reputation straight through the guano.\nInside the training area\nKestrel Trainer: Next time: faster and quieter.\nKestrel Trainee: How am I supposed to do THAT quietly?\nKestrel Trainer: Well, you could try not stomping your feet, to begin with.\nKestrel Trainee: I wasn't stomping my feet!\nKestrel Trainer: Not what it sounded like from over here.\nOn the stairs leading to the second floor\nKestrel Watchkeeper: Did you just come in from the trail?\nKestrel Stas: Been monitoring Speaker activity in the south. You?\nKestrel Watchkeeper: Been watching the road to New Kaineng.\nKestrel Stas: You see anything...strange?\nKestrel Watchkeeper: Strange how?\nKestrel Stas: Stuff not looking right—not acting right.\nKestrel Watchkeeper: Now that you mention it...two songbirds were attacking one another. Trying to peck each other to death.\nKestrel Stas: Hmm. Yeah.\nNear the Asura gate\nFledgling: I'm going on a trip! I'm gonna visit some long-long-long-lost cousins in the Domain of the Winds[sic]!\nSensali Scout: That's where I'm going as well. Not to visit anyone in particular, just to see how other tengu have gotten along.\nFledgling: That's neat! Maybe we'll see each other there!\nSensali Scout: I'll be sure to say hello if we do.\nAwakened Merchant: You buy now.\nNortheast of the Asura gate\nOld Man: Excuse me, are you Pei?\nKid: I am! And you're my great-uncle!\nOld Man: I am. As I'm sure your grandmother's told you, years ago I took a long journey on a flying boat out of Cantha...\nKid: Why? You didn't like Cantha?\nOld Man: Well, I had a powerful desire to see the world. A desire that's long since been fulfilled. And now, it's good to be home.\nIn the chapel\nArborstone Refugee: I can't believe my ancestors were fooled by you. I can't believe I was, for so long...\nArborstone Refugee: The Krytans said you left. I don't understand. Was it us? Were we not enough?\nArborstone Refugee: You promised to bless everyone who follows your teachings. How are you supposed to do that now?\nIn the library\nBalam Ri: Aah, paper cut! Time to switch hands— Wait, that one has a paper cut, too. Maybe I can turn the pages with my toes?\nBalam Ri: Oh my! I knew this was banned for salacious content, but I didn't realize there were diagrams...\nBalam Ri: Imagine if the public got hold of this. Pure chaos! Oh, it's so exciting!\nBalam Ri: Wow, never thought I'd get my hands on this. I know what I'm reading on my break.\nAfter Snargle moves in\nKestrel Choole: That charr writer—Snaffle?—gave me a free copy of one of his books! He even signed it!\nHead Librarian: Mm-hmm, have you looked through it yet?\nKestrel Choole: No, not yet.\nHead Librarian: I suggest you read a page or two.\n(short pause)\nKestrel Choole: Wait, this book... This is...\nHead Librarian: Smut. Yes. Mr. Goldclaw gave me a whole bundle for the library.\nKestrel Choole: Is it...good smut at least?\nHead Librarian: Ehhh...\nIn the reading room next to the library after completing Lost Lore\nBalam Ri: I've never seen so many primary sources in one place! Your work has been such an inspiration-\nBalam Ri: Commander, you made it! Oh, where are my manners? This is Decimus, Tyria's most esteemed chronicler!\nBalam Ri: He wants to discuss our work! With us! Isn't it wonderful?\nDecimus the Historian: Ah, yes, we're well acquainted. Your newest endeavor will be promptly added to your repertoire of accomplishments.\nDecimus the Historian: I hope to include your work in a new anthology I'm organizing. With your full permission, of course-\nBalam Ri: We'll do it! Err..I'm sure I speak for both of us when I say it would be an absolute honor.\nBalam Ri: Yessss! Oh my gods, oh my gods, oh my GODS!\nIn the mess hall\nKestrel Rookie: Do you have...anything else?\nHead Server: We don't have any fancy city food, if that's what you mean. We serve good, honest, stick-to-your-ribs food here.\nHead Server: Food that'll see you through a long day on the trail.\nKestrel Rookie: You know, that's actually pretty good.\nOn the balcony, third floor\nTourist: So this place used to be rubble?\nKestrel Sentinel: Oh yes, it was toppled. When our people first fled to Echovald, we used it as a place of refuge...\nKestrel Sentinel: But it really provided very little shelter. We Kestrels took it on ourselves to restore it over the years.\nNear the exit of the cathedral\nVisiting Merchant (tengu): What've you been moving?\nVisiting Merchant (human): Food, mostly. Everyone's happy for some new flavors.\nVisiting Merchant (human): This bag here? Full of carrot bread. Some fisherman in Shing Jea's nuts for the stuff...\nOutside Arborstone, after hatching the turtle egg\nRota: Make sure to say hello to the little fella before you take off.\nRota: Growin' up pretty fast, eh?\nRota: Someone missed you.\n\n\n== Crafting resources ==\nFishing nodes\n Deep Fishing Hole\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nConcept art\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nIt's possible to unfog the zu Heltzer Historical Site area while in Arborstone even though it is a part of the Echovald Wilds zone instead. The content guide may also point to it if it has not yet been unfogged.\nA bell, located on a platform above the fishing merchants, can be interacted with to obtain Zunraa's Gift after completing the A Guardian Once More collection.\nThe points of interest were added in the March 15, 2022 patch.\nResting was originally only applied to players staying in Arborstone Inn. The effect's radius was expanded to all of Arborstone in the March 29, 2022 patch. The same patch also saw the addition of diving goggles and the Arborstone Diver achievement.\nA waypoint was added to Club Canach in the April 19, 2022 patch.\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnd of Dragons Gameplay Overview, youtube.com",

      "strName": "Super Adventure Box",
      "strWikiText": "Super Adventure Box, or SAB, is a special activity originally introduced during the eponymous release as part of April Fools' Day 2013. Originally accessed by talking to Moto in Creator's Commons, it is a \"game within a game\" with an 8-bit platformer theme, sharing some elements with jumping puzzles, and uses the same enter mechanism as dungeons and thus can be completed alone or with a group of up to five players. The activity is character-based: any items and upgrades obtained on one character do not carry over to other characters. While inside, players are able to earn Bauble Bubbles that can be exchanged with Moto for various items.\nAll players start off on equal ground: Players will be under a hidden transform effect, effectively making all skills inaccessible except for the ones given inside the box. Current equipment and traits will have no effect on the character. The player cannot change, equip, or remove equipment while in the box. Prior to the March 29, 2022 update, all effects on the character were removed upon entering the box, including those from boosts. The only elements that persisted outside the box were items obtained in the box, such as baubles. Since this update, food, utility and other positive boosts are suspended and resumed upon return to Tyria.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nPortal to Super Adventure Box\nCreator's Commons (Rata Sum) located directly west of Magustan Court Waypoint\nHall of Monuments (Eye of the North) located next to Eye of the North Waypoint\n  Invitation to the Super Adventure Festival\n  Invitation to the Party\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n=== Hub ===\n\nThe Hub contains portal houses to four worlds and a gate back to Rata Sum. Players can start a world by entering a door and then selecting a difficulty level and zone. Players can only visit zones they have already completed. This acts as a level select mechanic for the platformer.\n\n\n=== Worlds and zones ===\nSuper Adventure Box is divided in four worlds, each in turn divided in a total of three zones plus a bonus zone. Each zone is unlocked after completing the previous one, and all of them can be accessed and played individually without needing to complete the entire world in a go. The first and second zones have a Cage as the final boss, while the third zones have a unique and harder boss. The bonus zone requires completion of the third zone to be accessed each time.\nWorlds three and four are not currently available, but might be available in the future.\n\n\n== Difficulty ==\n\n\n== Interface ==\n\nEnergy bar\nThe yellow bar represents the character's endurance, or ability to dodge in order to evade attacks in the SAB (Super Adventure Box) similarly to the rest of the game. Any enemy attack can be evaded if timed correctly, excluding traps like the flytraps (note, however, that ending the dodge roll inside an enemy causes damage and knockback)[verification requested].\n\nHearts\n\nThe number of hearts displayed represents the player's health bar. All players start off with three hearts. Normal hits received use up one heart, while weaker hits (from poisonous water, for example) can use up half a heart. The number of hearts, the player's total health, can be increased by gaining Heart Vessels. A Heart Vessel is obtained by defeating the final boss of each world in any mode. Players can only obtain one Heart Vessel per world. If a player loses all their hearts, they lose a life and are moved back to the last known checkpoint with maximum hearts. Players can restore lost hearts by eating food which can drop from enemies or from breaking items in shops. Players can also heal themselves as usual, by using skill #6, which requires recharging by purchasing Health Refills from shopkeepers. The Health Potion healing skill can hold up to 9 charges. It is currently not possible to heal other players.\nThere is no falling damage, no matter how far down the player falls or jumps, provided they land on a solid surface. Falling into an abyss, however, sends the player back to the last known checkpoint with one heart less.\n\nLives\n\nPlayers start off with two lives at the beginning of each zone, and more lives can be purchased from certain shopkeepers in each zone. When a player loses all their lives, they are moved to the Game Over room, surrounded by ticking bombs, rising lava, and spiked walls. However, Moto will be there to offer assistance, allowing players to either use a Continue Coin or purchase one for 50 Baubles, which will give them 5 lives (99 lives with an Infinite Continue Coin) and move them back to the last activated checkpoint. If the player has no continue coins and not enough baubles to buy one, or declines to buy one, they will be returned to the Hub and all progress on the zone they were on will be reset if they were either in Tribulation Mode or not in a party. Continue Coins are also available from Moto outside of the Super Adventure Box in Creator's Commons, at a cost of ten Baubles for one coin.\n\nBauble count\nBaubles are used as currency, allowing various skills and items to be purchased from the shopkeepers in the various levels of the SAB, as well as from Moto. Initially, players can carry only 250 baubles, but this limit can be increased to 500 with the purchase of a Bauble Purse and further to 750 with a Bauble Tote Bag. Once the limit is reached, or before that, one can exit the SAB and convert their baubles to Bauble Bubbles from Moto at the rate of 250 baubles for 1 bubble. The number shown is that of the baubles that are in the player character's inventory, excluding any which may be in their vault or on other characters.\nThe colors used by the baubles which can be picked up in the SAB are aligned with the rarity paradigm used for equipment, with different colored baubles granting a different number of blue baubles (the base currency):\n\n\tBaubles\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe baubles dropped by monsters will disappear if not picked up within a short time (around 10 sec).\n\n\n== Upgrades and skills ==\n\nMost upgrades and their corresponding skills, if any, are purchased from shopkeepers across each zone, or obtained as rewards. Skills and other purchased enhancements are character-bound (will only be available to that character which bought the skill). Being swallowed by certain enemies removes all skills except for a special skill which should be used to regain freedom.\n\nPower-ups\nPower-ups can be found inside of barrels in Super Adventure Box and grant the player specific buffs for a short time:\n\nDamage Boost causes players to deal double damage.\nInvincibility gives the player a buff that makes them invulnerable to incoming damage as well as poison water for the duration.\nInvisibility grants the player stealth.\nSpeed Boost gives the player a buff similar to Swiftness, increasing their movement speed.\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n== Rewards ==\nAlong with Baubles, various skins have a chance to be earned in game from Glorious Chests, as well as items to create certain skins outside of the Super Adventure Box. There are currently five skin sets, each containing all 16 non-aquatic weapons and a backpack, and each set shares the same models and animations, but is colored in a different hue, their color following the Bauble value color scale. Skins acquired as random drops from Glorious Chests can be traded, while skins from all other sources are account bound. Additionally, players can obtain Fancy Furniture Coins from hidden shops which can be used to create various guild decorations.\n\nGlorious Chests\nGlorious Chests are awarded for completing a zone in Normal Mode and Tribulation Mode. Each chest can only be acquired once a day per account for the zone and mode, making a total of 12 of these chests; one per zone in Normal Mode and one per zone in Tribulation Mode. The exception to this is the two bonus zones Cart and Robbers. They reward a single Bauble Bubble instead of a Glorious Chest of which can only be acquired once per day per account, regardless of difficulty. Each Glorious Chest contains:\n\n2   Bauble Bubbles (4 in World 2 in Tribulation Mode)\n1   Continue Coin\nThere is a small chance for it to contain the following:\n\n  Super weapon skins1\n  Super Weapon Box (Blue SAB weapons)\n  Kaiser Snake Weapon Box (Orange SAB weapons)\n1 The drop rate was 2% in 2013, the current rate has not been confirmed.\nEach completion of a zone will reward a Bonus Reward Chest that is awarded at the end of the timer for transition:\n\n5-50   Bauble (random amount, infantile mode does not give Bonus Reward Chest)\nAdditionally, upon completing the different zones in Tribulation mode, players will receive a trophy specific to that world and zone which can be used to craft various skins:\n\nCompleting World 1 zones will award items for crafting King Toad's weapon skins:\n  King Toad Z-1\n  King Toad Z-2\n  King Toad Z-3\nCompleting World 2 zones will award items for crafting Storm Wizard's weapon skins\n  Storm Wizard Z-1\n  Storm Wizard Z-2\n  Storm Wizard Z-3\n\n\n== Achievements and Collections ==\nAchievements\nSuper Adventure Box: World 1\nSuper Adventure Box: World 2\nSuper Adventure Box: Tribulation Mode\nSuper Adventure Box: Nostalgia\nDaily Super Adventure Festival achievements during the festival\nGuide to Daily Super Adventure Festival achievements\nWeapon Collections\nThe Super Adventure (Blue skins)\nThe King Toad (Green skins)\nThe Storm Wizard (Yellow skins)\nThe Kaiser (Orange skins)\nThe Crimson Assassin (Red skins)\nThe Glitched Adventure (\"Glitched\" blue skins)\n\n\n== Account unlocks ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\nScreenshots\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nBonus Reward Chest are given at the end of the timer for zone transition.\nZones are only unlocked per character and are not account bound.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nEach of bauble's color matches up with a Super Adventure Box weapon skin set: Blue Baubles/Super weapon skins, Green Baubles/King Toad weapon skins, Yellow Baubles/Storm Wizard's weapon skins, Red Baubles/Crimson Assassin weapon skins, and Purple Baubles/Hardlight weapons.\nThe bottom of the Super Coin says \"SAB ADMIT ONE\". The coin machine was removed with the release of World 2.\nDialogue within the Super Adventure Box is displayed in New Krytan, but is also translated in the chat panel for the player's convenience.\nThe titles of the books in the shops are written in New Krytan. Some of them read:\nPrincess Miya is not Moto (Red books)\nWhy Moto is Great (Blue books)\nAvoid the Genie! (Green books)\nThe open book on some tables seems to be the Red book, saying:\nAs you can see they are totally different people. This is clearly not Moto in a wig and dress.\n\n\n=== Tributes ===\nThe game pays tribute to the 8-bit genre especially to the Mario and Zelda series of games:\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Super Adventure Box Gem Store Offers\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuper Adventure Box on official website\nSuper Adventure Box advertisement - ArenaNet released a tongue-in-cheek video inviting people to play Super Adventure Box.\nSuper Adventure Box is now open\nThe origin of the Super Adventure Box\nThe origin of the Super Adventure Box video\nLord Vanquish Twitter feed\n\n\n== References ==",

Perhaps due to the unstable release of magic following the deaths of two Elder Dragons, it has established a foothold in Tyria, allowing visitors to easily come and go. It features most services and crafting stations, and is unusual amongst lounges in that it exists within its own unique map.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nAccess requires one of the two types of Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey:\n\n  Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey — 1,000  from the Gem Store.\n  Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey (2 weeks) — 150  from the Gem Store.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n Mistlock Sanctuary Waypoint — \n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nFractal Explorer\nMistwalker Ilia\nMysterious Bartender\nWarrior\n\n\n=== Services ===\n Aesthetician\n Black Lion Chest Merchant\n Black Lion Exchange Specialist\n Black Lion Weapons Specialist\n BY-TK10\n FIX-0255\n Merchant (Dungeon Armor and Weapons)\n Merit Professor Rizzak\n Mystic Forge Attendant\n Sanctuary Krewe\n SL-5001\n Tekka (Gathering Merchant)\n TRD-0B4\n\n\n=== Fractal vendors ===\n BLING-9009\n BUY-2046 PFR\n BUY-4373\n Deroir (Account Augmentations)\n INFUZ-5959\n Mist Potion Brewer\n\n\n=== Master crafters ===\n Ballistics Genius Virkk\n Explosives Visionary Pirakk\n Flavor Scholar Raima\n Gemwork-Savant Raxxa\n Hide Synthesist Teekzi\n Statics Expert Korbit\n Textile Synergist Vizza\n Theoretician Straff\n\n\n=== Guild services ===\n Black Lion Researcher (Guild Bank)\n ACLM-0403 (Guild Commendation Trader)\n\n\n== Objects ==\nCrafting stations\n Armorsmithing Station\n Artificing Station\n Cooking Station\n Huntsman's Station\n Jeweling Station\n Leatherworking Station\n Tailoring Station\n Weaponsmithing Station\nOther\n Dungeon - Fractals of the Mists\nGlobolla Marble\n Mystic Forge\n Portal to Tyria\n\n\n== Crafting resources ==\nBulk ingredients\n Flavor Scholar Raima\n  Basil Leaves in Bulk\n  Bell Peppers in Bulk\n  Buttermilk in Bulk\n  Cheese Wedges in Bulk\n  Ginger Root in Bulk\n  Rice in Bulk\n  Sour Cream in Bulk\n  Tomatoes in Bulk\n  Yeast in Bulk\n\n\n== Notes ==\nGeneral\nIt is not possible to park characters in the Mistlock Sanctuary and then transfer the pass to other characters via the bank. Upon logging back onto the character without a pass, they will be expelled from the map.\nPlacing the permanent pass into a Shared Inventory Slot will allow all characters simultaneous access to the Sanctuary.\nIt is possible to waypoint out of the Sanctuary by navigating to the lower layers of the world map.\nSelecting \"Return to my previous map\" from the central portal will teleport you to your exact previous location; for example, the end of a jumping puzzle you were at. The same is true when using the pass again.\nThis fails if the character has gone to its home instance using the Home Portal Stone and then returned to the Mistlock Sanctuary.\nThe map doesn't have the day and night cycle and it is constantly 11:00 noon of Tyrian time.\nPhysics\nPlayers will be affected by  Cosmic Energy while in this map, allowing them to jump higher. They will also have access to the special action skill   Nova Launch.\nGliders will rise upwards. There is an invisible ceiling to prevent them from rising too high. Gliders that are already above the ceiling will descend to it.\nThere is an invisible \"floor\" beneath \"street\" level of the islands but above their lowest level; players who fall off the edge will bounce up and down for a while until they find the \"resting\" level, and can move (float) around normally. \"Jumping\" while floating like this will launch the player into the air by activating the player's glider.\n\nMinigame\nPlayers may interact with the control panel at the base of the tree in the northeast corner to spawn a Globolla Marble, similar to those found during Viirastra's encounter in the Shattered Observatory. Successfully bouncing the marble back to its tree (by ensuring a player is present at each bounce) will cause it to become stationary and begin glowing; interacting with it at this point will result in the following:\nThe player is turned into a fiery orb and granted the effect  You are a being of pure light and energy., allowing them to float in midair.\nSkills are replaced with   Increase Gravity and   Decrease Gravity, which can be used to adjust how high you float, and the special action skill is changed to   Nova Dash.",

It was first a dwarven foundry and mine until the Stone Summit took it over to use as their main base of operations, naming it Sorrow's Furnace, where they enslaved various races including the dredge. In 1072 AE, the Stone Summit were defeated in the dwarven civil war and the dredge began revolting, forming the moletariate and claiming the mines, renaming it Sorrow's Embrace. Recently, however, the moletariat have become corrupted and influenced by the Inquest, turning to enslave their own kind in continuous mining.\nCompleting this dungeon's explorable mode or its reward track awards Tales of Dungeon Delving, which can be used to purchase the dungeon's armor and weapons from any Dungeon Merchant.\n\n\n== Dungeon modes ==\n\nSorrow's Embrace (story)\nSorrow's Embrace (explorable)\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nIf you do not have the Sorrow's Embrace Waypoint, head to it through Tribulation Rift or you can sneak in from Heimdahl's Last Stand hugging the cliff face on your right and making a few jumps down.\nFollow the water towards the northwest wall.

This tooth of Jormag was knocked out by the great hero Asgeir Dragonrender and brought down to Hoelbrak during the norn's exodus from the north. It was chained to the ceiling from the gum at the root of the tooth, and left as both a testament to the only norn to harm the Elder Dragon and as a challenge to all norn of the future.\nIt is believed far and wide by the norn that if none can damage the fang in any form, the norn have no hope of facing and defeating Jormag themself. As such, youthful norn use the fang to test their mettle, to prove if they would be the one who leads their people to victory. Though countless attempts have been made, none have succeeded in over 100 years. Over time, many norn - especially the older norn like Ulf - see the fang as less a barrier to surpass and more a deterrent to keep the brash norn from charging to their deaths, hoping that the fang never breaks and seeing no reason to believe damaging a tooth means being able to damage Jormag itself. Others, however, believe that they should not wait for the tooth to be broken and march north regardless, seeing Jormag as a threat that would not idly wait for foes to meet territory. Still other norn, such as Mattul Krigheset, wish to use the tooth itself against Jormag, setting indestructible against indestructible.\nIn 1319 AE, Destiny's Edge attempted to break the tooth after destroying the Dragonspawn, a powerful champion of Jormag in its southern territory. Eir used axes enhanced by Wolf as well as her personal chisel and mallet, and even using her Bear Form. Afterwards, Rytlock Brimstone (with Sohothin) and Logan Thackeray offered to attempt but were held back by Eir. Caithe and Zojja both withheld any offer, the former knowing of the power of the Elder Dragons and seeing the attempt as futile while the latter finding it absurd the norn could believe that physical attacks would do anything against a magical creature.\nIn 1320 AE, the famous smith Beigarth rediscovered a means to craft Deldrimor Steel and intended to craft a weapon that may break Jormag's tooth. Though the weapon was forged, no known attempt was made on the tooth itself.\n\n\n== Combat abilities ==\nEffects\n Invulnerability - Immune to conditions and damage.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Fang of the Serpent has been confirmed to be a chipped-off section of Jormag's tusk as opposed to a fang. However, the presence of the gum on the tusk fragment contradicts this statement.\n\n\n== References ==",

There has been speculation that the responsible ancients may have done so in anticipation for later generations harnessing visions of the past to fortify themselves for the challenges yet to come.\n\n\n=== Guild Wars: Eye of the North ===\nIn 1078 AE, the year that the Elder Dragon Primordus was originally supposed to awaken, the Scrying Pool was able to show the human hero commemorated in the Hall of Monuments a vision of the Great Destroyer's lair, allowing the Deldrimor dwarves and their allies to defeat the Great Destroyer and delay the awakening of the Elder Dragons.\nThe Scrying Pool was also able to show specific visions when brought certain mementos tied to specific people or events, which allowed it to locate Lieutenant Keiran Thackeray after he had gone missing in action during the Krytan Civil War.\n\n\n=== Interim years ===\nInspired by his experiences during the campaign against the Great Destroyer, the asura Vekk began studying the Scrying Pool. Based on contemporary accounts describing Vekk's knowledge of scrying pools, he might have found clues that more than one such pool existed on Tyria.\nAn unknown author wrote a message intended for a future champion following in the previous hero's footsteps. The message speculated on the reasons for the Scrying Pool's existence and urged future heroes to uncover the relics of their history and master the power of the pool in order to prepare for future challenges.\nThe Scrying Pool flooded over the following centuries, filling much of the central chamber.\n\n\n=== The Icebrood Saga ===\nIn 1332 AE, the Elder Dragon Aurene was drawn to the Eye of the North because of its confluence of energies which connected many threads throughout time in the Mists. Aurene tried to search through the visions in the Scrying Pool to find ways to break the destructive cycle of dragonrises but in vain. However, she learned about Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer and Ryland Steelcatcher's adventures in Darkrime Delves and persuaded her champion, the Pact Commander, to relive these events via visions so the Commander would gain insight into Bangar and Ryland's respective ambitions and the fate that befell General Almorra Soulkeeper.\nAfter experiencing the vision involving Ryland and Bangar, the Commander found a message about the Scrying Pool written by an unknown party in the distant past, and followed the written instructions to begin the process of mastering the Scrying Pool's powers. The Commander brought mementos of past battles to the pool and witnessed visions of notable moments in the lives of their allies Braham Eirsson, Canach, Kasmeer Meade, Marjory Delaqua, and Rox.\n\n\n== References ==",

When Jormag rose, this tribe of kodan had to abandon their Sanctuary and built a ship of timber and sailed southward. The ship was caught in the shifting waters and stranded the tribe, before the waters froze again. In the 160 years that followed, the kodan of Still Waters Speaking have heard the whispers from the still-dormant Drakkar, who had returned in the recent months with Kralkatorrik's death and Aurene's rise as an Elder Dragon. Over this time, the kodan's numbers have been slowly decimated by Jormag's influence, leaving their Claw of Koda, Cloudseeker, bereft of the guidance of their Voice. Their experiences with Jormag have left them highly suspicious of outsiders, though with Drakkar's emergence, Bright Shore and his two companions were sent as envoys to eastern Bjora Marches to ask the Vigil for help.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nA kodan named Still Waters can be found at the Song of Final Exile within Snowden Drifts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nA History of Still Waters Speaking: Part One\nA History of Still Waters Speaking: Part Two\nKoda's Promise, Koda's Gift\n\n\n== References ==",

Local Stone Summit dwarves sensed great magic within and ordered their dredge slaves to excavate the area in order to reach it. The source of the magic turned out to be the trapped undead lich Zoldark the Unholy who promised the dwarves unimaginable power if he was freed from his tomb. However, unbeknownst to the miners, he gradually began possessing their minds to turn them into his enslaved minions.\nThanks to the information delivered by worried dredge slaves who were struggling against the lich's spreading influence, a party of heroes realized the threat and descended into the Vloxen Excavations where they defeated Zoldark in the heart of his tomb.\n\n\n== Locations and objectives ==\nPoints of Interest\n Vloxen Mine — \n Vloxen Shards — \nVistas\n Vloxen Mine Vista — \n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nCharr\nAsh Legion Scout\nAsh Legion Shadow\nAsh Legion Spy\nBlood Legion Blademaster\nBlood Legion Duelist\nBlood Legion Soldier\nCook\nFlame Legion Axe Fiend\nFlame Legion Fire Shaman\nIron Legion Engineer\nIron Legion Marksman\nIron Legion Sentinel\nIron Legion Soldier\nMedic\nSentry\nSolicitus Foecrusher\nHuman\nSeraph Soldier\n\n\n=== Services ===\n United Legions Quaestor\n\n\n=== Foes ===\n\nAmbient creatures\nRabbit\nRaccoon\nAnimals\nBlue Moa Bird\nCave Bat\nDoe\nVeteran Blue Moa Bird\nBats\nCave Bat\nCharr\nDominion Axe Fiend\nDominion Blademaster\nDominion Duelist\nDominion Engineer\nDominion Fire Shaman\nDominion Marksman\nDominion Sentinel\nDominion Shadow\nDominion Sniper\nDominion Soldier\nDominion Stalker\nVeteran Dominion Marksman\nVeteran Dominion Scout\nVeteran Dominion Sentinel\nVeteran Dominion Shadow\nSpiders\nForest Spider\nVeteran Forest Spider\n\n\n== Ambient dialogue ==\nNear the Mine Front Gate\nBlood Legion Soldier (1): You hear something suspicious, you shoot first.\nBlood Legion Soldier (2): What if it's not an enemy?\nBlood Legion Soldier (1): It's always an enemy.\nBlood Legion Soldier (2): Yeah...got it.\nNear the Vloxen Mine Vista\nAsh Legion Shadow: So, you read the new Snargle Goldclaw novel yet?\nIron Legion Sentinel: Why would I read that trash?\nAsh Legion Shadow: It's a good distraction.

The origins of these structures remain unclear, though they were once used by the shaman caste as a place of worship, torture, and execution. Ghosts of those killed in Ascalon now haunt these ruins, led by Lady Murakai.\n\n\n== History ==\n250 years ago, its entrance was Doomlore Shrine, a former shrine to the Titans full of dark magic. The cathedral and shrine were used as a base of operations by Scorch Maulclaw of the shaman caste, who was tasked by Hierophant Burntsoul to hunt down, capture, and execute Pyre Fierceshot and his warband after they destroyed a charr temple. After Scorch Maulclaw's death, Pyre and the Hero of Ascalon went into the Cathedral of Flames to free the Fierce Warband from Flamemaster Maultooth, Scorch's chief torturer, who unleashed Charr Effigies on the rescue party.\nAfter their freedom, Doomlore Shrine was used as an outpost by the Fierce warband and the Hero of Ascalon as they began the charr rebellion. Hoping to find means to improve their disposition, the Fierce warband began exploring the Cathedral of Flames and discovered a collapsed tunnel. Clearing out the rubble led to a treasure vault full of spoils from Rin, Surmia, and Diessa. However, the souls of Ascalonians killed by the charr for these treasures were attached to the spoils of war, and were brought north along with. With the rubble blocking their path cleared, they swarmed out attacking the charr. Among the souls of the dead was a powerful necromancer, Murakai, who planned to channel the power of the souls to create a Storm of Souls to attack all the living. Fearing ghosts, Gron Fierceclaw requested the assistance of the Hero to bring Murakai down. They succeeded, though knew that Murakai could return one day.\nIn the time since then, Doomlore Shrine has become abandoned as the souls have begun flooding out of the Cathedral of Flames. Murakai remains, attempting to kill the living as she makes the cathedral her home.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the site of the real Ash Legion base of operations in Grothmar Valley, set up to investigate reports of resurging Renegades activity in the homelands. The Ash Training Course adventure can be found here.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nAt first, the player may be tempted to try the big locked gate accessible via the river west of the point of interest, but this is the exit. The entrance is hinted at by Malice Swordshadow during Revels & Rivals: \"Oh, and Commander? The carvings will lead you. That's all.\"\nEnter Malice's tent at the  Ash Legion Camp —  in Devourer's Ridge. To the right of her (see below) is a small cabinet with four symbols carved onto it. Memorize them. The exact combination of symbols changes daily.\nNow head south into The Wardowns. Scattered about this area are eight trees (see below) onto which a unique symbol has been carved; your job is to seek out the four whose symbols match the ones you found in Malice's tent and activate each tree in the correct order. You will hear a clicking sound if you selected the correct tree, but will be inflicted with burning if you select the wrong one or activated it out of order, and will have to start over.\nUpon activating the final tree, a dialogue window will pop up informing you that a secret chute has opened. Enter it to access the Cove.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tips ===\nCommanders can set 4 different map markers directly on the world map, allowing to mark the 4 locations in order based on the locations shown in the previous map: Personal waypoint, attack order, defend order and rally order.\nGiving each symbol a distinct name and typing them in chat helps remembering them and their order. For example, the arrow with 3 heads can be called \"tree\", or \"arrow\", and the 6 interlocking lines can be called \"valley\" or \"waves\". Creating a story out of the symbols can also help you remember them without having to write them down; for example, The happy man found a tree and cut it down with his axe before rolling the logs into the valley.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nRecon Cove features several objects of note:\nA rocky prism elevated by ley magic can be seen in a containment chamber. It resembles those utilized by djinn in the Zagonur Cliffs to withstand the Dragonbrand.\nA range of purple screens and keypads commonly seen among asura can be found along the southeastern wall.\nA poster in front of the screens features an Orrian archway and a Canthan bridge, and a diagram of a Leviathan resembling the creatures found in Seitung and New Kaineng harbors. All text, including labels, is written in asuran. At the time of Grothmar Valley's release, neither Cantha nor living Leviathans were accessible ingame.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Related achievements ==\n Daily Icebrood Saga: Daily Grothmar Codebreaker — Break the code to find what is hidden.

It stood as a symbol of resilience against Zhaitan and his Risen minions.\nThe lighthouse was refurbished in 1240 AE and again in 1250 AE, but in 1325 AE, the ancient karka attacked Lion's Arch and razed the lighthouse to its ancient foundations. A more modern replacement was built nearby, but the site of the original was still maintained and accessible.\nOnly two years later, as a result of the Battle for Lion's Arch in 1327 AE, the base of the original lighthouse was crushed under the Wreckage of the Breachmaker and its replacement was left standing crooked and threatening to fall. When Lion's Arch was rebuilt in 1328 AE, both sites were completely demolished and replaced by a new lighthouse, with the name being changed to Phoenix Roost. This new lighthouse bears a resemblance to a spiral seashell.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Related achievements ==\n Explorer: Dive Master — Find and use 38 diving locations.

      "strName": "Fractals of the Mists",
      "strWikiText": "Fractals of the Mists are a special type of dungeon that consists of an array of mini-dungeons called fractals, where each fractal has its own story and environment. Characters are adjusted to level 80 within the fractal. Fractals are one of the primary sources of ascended equipment and provide materials for crafting infused equipment and attuned equipment. They are one of the core pillars of Guild Wars 2's endgame.\nFractals have some unique mechanics and design. The party can choose the difficulty scale prior to entering the fractal or from within the observatory. This difficulty scale starts at 1 and can be increased, up to 100. The personal fractal level is an account-wide stat that tracks the current position of the account on the difficulty scale. To increase the personal fractal level, and therefore the highest fractal scale accessible to the account, the player must complete a single fractal on a fractal scale equal or greater to their personal fractal level. This provides progression, allowing players to continuously complete higher and higher levels on the difficulty scale and earn greater rewards as a result.\nWhen entering Fractals of the Mists, the players arrive in Mistlock Observatory, a \"hub\" area within the Mists. Entering Mistlock, you'll meet Dessa, a scientist who has made explorable chunks of reality from the Mists. There are hostile elements that were acquired during Mistlock which you are asked to dispose of. You may begin by entering the portal within the Mistlock to enter a fractal. You will hear Dessa's voice while stabilizing the fractal. Once it is stabilized, she and her krewe will transport you back to the Mistlock.\n\n\n== Introduction letter ==\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nLion's Arch - The entrance is an asura gate directly in the center of Fort Marriner in Lion's Arch. Located just south of the \"Mist Portals\" point of interest, look for this icon  on the map.\nMistlock Sanctuary - Requires Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey. The entrance is on the eastern side.\nOnce any member of your party has entered, you will be prompted to join them from anywhere within Lion's Arch or Mistlock Sanctuary.\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\n\n=== Matchmaking ===\n\n\n=== Difficulty scale ===\n\nFractals of the Mists uses a difficulty scale in contrast to the story and explorable modes of dungeons.\n\nYour personal fractal level increases by one each time you complete a fractal scale equal to or greater than your personal level.\nWhoever enters the hub may choose the initial difficulty level, which can be set up to the highest personal fractal level of any member of the current party.\nThe scale may be changed while in the lobby through the Scale Setting Sequencer.\nIncreased personal levels offer increased rewards, even if the run is at a lower difficulty level. Higher difficulty levels offer greater challenges and higher chances of better rewards, from foes, chests, and bonus chests.\nEach fractal scale corresponds with a specific fractal 'island' and set of unique conditions.\nThere are four fractal difficulty scale ranges that are listed in the Looking For Group tool. For new characters, all of these skill ranges are locked (they cannot be used to find groups). The first scale range called \"Initiate Scales 1-25\", will unlock when a character reaches level 80. Higher group scale ranges will unlock when an account's personal fractal level nears the upper boundary for that group. For example, the ability to search in the 51-75 range unlocks when an account's personal fractal level is 46. More details can be found on the page Looking For Group.\nStandard changes at higher difficulty levels\nStandard foes spawn in greater numbers and have higher levels.\nFoes gain increased health and damage values.\nSome foes will gain new abilities, e.g. in the Uncategorized Fractal, the harpies start to knock players back.\nMajor changes at different tiers\nFractals include more substantial changes starting at level 25, 50, 75, so these are called the difficulty \"tiers\".\n\nNew items begin dropping at higher tiers; other items begin dropping more frequently.\nNew challenges are added at new tiers:\nAgony is added to enemy and boss attacks at level 20, and it continues to increase with each level.\nA Mistlock Instability is added at level 26, with additional instabilities added at levels 51 and 76 (for a total of 3).\nStarting at level 71, whenever a player gets downed a Fractal Avenger will spawn to finish the player.\nInterrupting or killing it will cause it to disappear. If a downed player stealths or teleports away, it will continue its finisher, but it will fail if a player is still stealthed or has moved far enough away by the time its animation finishes.\nFractals with the Fractal Vindicator instability will spawn a Fractal Vindicator instead, which deals heavy damage to its target and persists until slain. Unlike with the avengers, only one vindicator will spawn per player whenever they go downed until their current vindicator has been slain.\nDaily Fractals rewards are available for difficulties 1-25, 26-50, 51-75 and 76-100.\n\n\n=== Mistlock Observatory ===\nThe Mistlock Observatory serves as the hub (or lobby) area for the dungeon. It offers armor repairs and a variety of merchants that sell fractal related gear, potions, and infusions. A portal in the center of the area can be used to access the fractals; this requires confirmation from all players in the party.\n\n\n=== Differences from dungeons ===\nThere are no waypoints. If any party member dies, they must wait to be revived by their party or for the rest of the party to get out-of-combat, at which point any defeated member is given the option to teleport back to the most recently completed checkpoint (or to leave the fractal entirely).\nAny character that re-enters an existing fractal instance (excluding the lobby) will spawn dead.\nAny characters under level 80 will be scaled up, allowing lower-level characters to participate, though stats gained from gear will still be lower, and mobs will generally target lower leveled players specifically.\n\n\n=== Agony ===\n\nAgony is an effect introduced starting at scale 20, reducing healing and dealing a large percentage of your maximum health as damage per second. The amount of damage inflicted gradually increases as the difficulty scale increases, starting at 10% and capping out at 180%. Certain mechanics, mistlock instabilities, and enemy attacks will apply Agony.\nThe damage taken from Agony can be reduced with Agony Resistance, down to a minimum of 1%. The main source of Agony Resistance are from infusions that can be placed in Ascended and Legendary equipment. Temporary Agony Resistance can be obtained from using an Anguished Tear of Alba.\n\n\n=== Mistlock Instability ===\nMistlock Instabilities are special modifiers that have various effects on players and their party's journey through the Fractals of the Mists. These can be anything from simple conditions to insidious extra creature attacks. These effects start at difficulty scale 26. Starting at difficulty scale 51 there are two Mistlock Instabilities active, and at scale 76 there are three Mistlock Instabilities active. Active instabilities can be previewed from the difficulty scale selected or viewed on your effects bar. Mistlock Instabilities will be assigned randomly every day.\n\nMistlock instability iteration\n\nHistorical Mistlock Instabilities\nThese mistlock instabilities were either renamed, reworked, or removed.\n\n\n=== Fractal Masteries ===\nFractal Attunements is a special mastery track introduced with Heart of Thorns. In addition to providing access to additional rewards and daily achievements, these masteries unlock certain NPCs in the Mistlock Observatory. Through these NPCs players can gain access to Infusion Extraction Devices, special crafting materials and other rewards. These are extremely helpful in completing the higher difficulty scales. In addition, players pursuing the Legendary Backpiece collection will need high fractal mastery to obtain the rare collection items required.\n\n\n=== Fractal Potions ===\n\nThere are three types of fractal potions available: offensive (increased outgoing damage), defensive (decreased incoming damage) and mobility (increased movement speed) potions. These consumables stack up to five times (Large potions apply all five stacks in one use), and can be used in addition to nourishment and utility consumables. Depending on the Fractal Attunement mastery rank achieved, each potion may provide additional bonuses to vitality, toughness and concentration, respectively.\n\n\n=== Account Augmentations ===\nAccount Augmentations are upgrades that can be purchased from Deroir and grant additional rewards for completing a fractal and account wide agony resistance. Each upgrade has four tiers and get progressively more expensive.\n\n\n== List of fractals ==\n\n1 Foe types are listed for those interested in using appropriate nourishment and/or sigils.\n2 Sigil of the Night is effective in the fractals that are in permanent nighttime, including the Solid Ocean fractal with the Jade Maw.\n3 There is only a single foe or a group of this type in the fractal.\n4 Powerful Potion of Outlaw Slaying is effective as bandits are outlaws.\n\n\n=== Fractal levels ===\nEach difficulty scale corresponds with a specific fractal 'island'. Agony is introduced at level 20, and its damage increases with the scale. The table below shows the island for each scale plus the minimum amount of agony resistance required to reduce damage from agony to its minimum of 1% of your total health per tick.\n(You can reach this table from in-game at any time by typing /wiki fl into the chat box.)\n\n\n== Daily Fractals ==\nThere are two types of daily fractals: Tier N and Recommended. In every tier there is at least one fractal for each of the three Tier N Dailies. In each of the three lower tiers (1-25, 26-50, 51-75) there will be one Recommended fractal.\nAll Daily Fractal reward chests contain a Pristine Fractal Relic and some +1 Agony Infusions.\n(Click here to purge the server cache, this forces the server to update the contents.)\n\n\n=== Tier N Fractals ===\nThe Tier N Fractal daily achievements are on a 15-day rotation as indicated on the following table.\n\nCompleting a daily fractal will reward players with a chest depending on which tier was completed:\n\nTier 1 - Fractal Initiate's Chest\nTier 2 - Fractal Adept's Chest and all lower tiers\nTier 3 - Fractal Expert's Chest and all lower tiers\nTier 4 - Fractal Master's Chest and all lower tiers\n\n\n=== Recommended Fractals ===\nRecommended fractals are on a 15-day rotation; one at each tier excluding Master.\n\nAdept and Expert tier Recommended fractals require the Follows Advice mastery. Unlike the Tier N fractals, Recommended fractals are always a single scale.\nCompleting a Recommended fractal will reward players with a Research Chest depending on the tier. All Research Chests will give a Fractal Research Page and a large Fractal Potion depending on the chest.\n\nFractal Initiate's Research Chest - Large Mist Defensive Potion\nFractal Adept's Research Chest - Large Mist Mobility Potion\nFractal Expert's Research Chest - Large Mist Offensive Potion\nFractal Research Pages, in conjunction with Grandmaster Marks, can be used to exchange for Ascended chests through BLING-9009. They can also be used to combine into Fractal Journals, which are used for certain steps of the Ad Infinitum collection and towards acquiring Mist Attunement 1 and Mist Attunement 3.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n\n\n=== Personal Fractal Level Rewards ===\nYour personal fractal level will increase by 1 each time a fractal difficulty scale is completed at or above your current personal fractal level.\nCompleting a fractal awards you up to 3400 karma. Less karma is received if completing a fractal scale closer to your own personal fractal level, although the amount can be increased with karma modifiers.\n\n\n=== Purchasable Reward bonuses ===\nDeroir offers permanent reward increases for your account. They include bonus experience, bonus karma, bonus fractal relics and bonus encryptions.\n\n\n=== Completion Rewards ===\n+1 Agony Infusions\nCharacter equipment (blue quality or higher)\nRecipe: Superior Rune of Resistance (above level 30)\nRecipe: Superior Sigil of Momentum (above level 30)\n\n\n==== Fractal Relics ====\nCompleting a fractal grants a certain amount of fractal relics depending on the scale:\n\nEach level of Mist Attunement acquired adds 1 Handful of Fractal Relics (Scales 1-50) or 1 Pouch of Fractal Relics (Scales 51-100), respectively worth an additional 3 and 5 relics each.\n\n\n==== Fractal Encryptions ====\nCompleting a fractal grants a certain amount of fractal encryptions depending on the scale:\n\nEach level of Mist Attunement acquired increases the number of encryptions dropped by 1.\nThe Chaos Isles Fractal, Nightmare Fractal and the Deepstone Fractal give 1 extra Fractal Encryption on scales below 40 and 2 extra Fractal Encryption on scales higher than 40.\nThere is also a small chance to get a Fractal Encryption Key instead of one Fractal Encryption.\n\n\n==== Experience ====\nCompleting fractals awards experience central Tyria mastery experience in the form of Writs of Tyrian Mastery:\n\nEach level of Fractal Empowerment acquired increases the number of writs dropped by 1.\n\n\n=== Ascended Crafting Materials ===\nCertain crafting materials can be obtained as random loot from foes in the Fractals of the Mists; unlike the above rewards, these drop from killing ordinary enemies, not for completing fractals. Each has a minimum difficulty scale at which it can appear.

(historical) — a category from the Fractured release\n\n\n== Tips ==\nSkills that block, absorb or reflect projectiles are very important in the Fractals of the Mists, as almost all fractals have multiple enemies that use ranged attacks and skills and many of them let you deal massive spike damage if you time your reflections properly.\nSkills that provide Stability, Blind or Weakness and skills that remove Conditions and Boons are very useful during many encounters in the Fractals of the Mists. Be prepared to switch skills often before different encounters.\nSkills that remove or corrupt enemy Boons are especially useful in higher-tier fractals with the 'No Pain, No Gain' instability, all the dredge fractals as well as some parts of Aetherblade-themed fractals.\nCrowd control skills such as dazes, stuns and knockbacks help break defiance bars, which give your party a reprieve from boss attacks while boosting your own damage. This technique is critical in some fractals such as Nightmare and Shattered Observatory, where bosses have devastating attacks that can only be stopped by breaking it.\nSome enemies, like Jade Colossi in Solid Ocean, who reflect most projectiles and are best fought with melee or non-projectile based attacks.\n\n\n== Related achievements ==\n Daily: Daily Fractal — Complete 1 fractal in the Fractals of the Mists through the portal in Lion's Arch.

For instance, you need at least three to complete the Underground Facility.\nThe Fractal Instability Trainer gives access to a training area where players can test their build against agony, mistlock instabilities, and enemies of various ranks.\nIn-game description:\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nFractals of the Mists was introduced as part of the Lost Shores release (November 16th, 2012), which also added the first ascended items into the game.\n3 new fractals and 2 new boss fractals were introduced as part of Fractured release (November 26th 2013). These are Thaumanova Reactor Fractal, Aetherblade Fractal, Molten Furnace Fractal, Captain Mai Trin Boss Fractal and the Molten Boss Fractal. In addition, personal fractal levels were made account-bound rather than character-bound.\nThe entrance to Fractals of the Mists originally was outside the Consortium Gift Shop in Fort Marriner in Lion's Arch. With the destruction of Lion's Arch (Escape from Lion's Arch release) it was moved to Vigil Keep in Gendarran Fields. During the rebuilding of Lion's Arch (May 19th, 2015 patch) the entrance was relocated to Postern Ward, and after the building work was completed (June 23rd, 2015 patch) it moved back to Fort Marriner.\nNumerous changes took effect with the Heart of Thorns release (October 23rd, 2015). These include an increase of the max scale to 100, introduction of new challenges and instabilities, the legendary fractal backpiece, the elimination of the old 4 fractals islands per run system, and a complete reworking of fractal rewards.\nSince Heart of Thorns' release and during the timeframe of Living World Season 3, the Fractals have seen the addition of three new fractals (Chaos Isles, Nightmare and Shattered Observatory) and numerous quality-of-life changes in order to make them more engaging. Major highlights include the streamlining of Agony infusions, revamp of the Mistlock Observatory lobby and reworks to the Cliffside, Swampland, Snowblind and Thaumanova Reactor fractals.\nWith the release of the first Living World Season 4 Episode: Daybreak (November 28th, 2017) the Twilight Oasis fractal was introduced. The Molten Boss and Mai Trin fractals were also reworked.\nWith the release of Living World Season 4, Episode 3: Long Live the Lich (June 26, 2018) the Deepstone fractal was introduced.\nWith the release of Living World Season 4, Episode 5: All or Nothing (January 8, 2019) the Siren's Reef fractal was introduced.\nOn September 15, 2020, the Sunqua Peak fractal was introduced.\n\n\n== External links ==\nFractals of the Mists teaser",

Head south from  Cuatl Waypoint — , towards Oola's  Hero Challenge. Speak to Researcher Orl there, or head inside if he's already through the outer door. Wait for any dialogue, then place an Energy Crystal in the Matrix Imprint Lock. (An Energy Crystal may be cheaply purchased on the Trading Post if you don't have one.) The event will start and the locked door will open.\n\n\n=== Back door with mounts ===\nWith the use of a mount such as a Springer or Skyscale, you can break into the lab outside of the event. Note that the defenses will still be active, making the area much more dangerous.\nThe easiest route is to enter through the exit tunnel south of the lab. Start from  Akk Wilds Waypoint —  and head directly northeast, looking for a ledge with a purple flower and a Chest visible. Jump up onto it using your mount, then follow the tunnel north into the lab, looking out for turrets as you go. \nAlternatively, you may be able to jump over the gap above the door, using either a Springer or Griffon [verification requested]. You will have to dismount while in the gap in order to fit through. Because of the immediate danger of the turrets, you may be unable to mount again on the other side, so this method is not recommended.\nThe turrets fire a homing projectile called Necrotic Energy, which can only travel along the ground and up slopes or walls to a certain degree. Because they stick to the ground, these projectiles can be avoided by staying in the air, either by gliding where possible, or using a flying mount such as the Skyscale or Griffon.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nIt is not required to enter the lab to receive map completion credit for this location: just approach the door.\nThe turrets' attacks will appear in the combat log as \" hits you for # using Necrotic Energy\", indicating that they are unnamed.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe descriptions of Oola's Data Crystal and Oola's Study on Ancient Magic both refer to this location as \"Old Oola's Lab\", implying that might be the intended name.\nOola's Lab also appeared in the original Guild Wars. However, that location is west of Rata Sum, so it is likely to be a different lab than this one.",

A secondborn Sylvari, Fiana, sacrificed her life to protect her friends, dying at the roots of the tree. Since then, it has begun bearing a powerful fruit that strengthens those who eat it. Pieces of the Terebinth still seem to have some magical power, even after having been removed from the tree proper. The sacred tree is tended to and protected by several sylvari gardeners.\nThe Terebinth's gardeners don't have an easy job, however, as many threats surround the Terebinth. Some threats are of a more mundane variety, like the termites near the base of the hill the tree rests on, or the weeds that spring up near it. The greatest threat to the tree, though, are the Nightmare Court forces from the Beldame's Rise, who make frequent attacks against the tree. They seek to cast some sort of dark ritual on the Terebinth that will twist and corrupt it to their ends. As such, Gardener Leigheara asks that travelers help her protect the tree.\n\n\n== Events ==\n  Protect the Revered Terebinth gardeners (17)\n  Recover the Revered Terebinth from the Nightmare Court (17)\n\n\n== NPCs ==\n\n\n=== Allies ===\nSylvari\nGardener Leigheara (17)\nGardener Marithelle (17)\nGardener Rowan (17)\nGardener Yarrow (17)\n\n\n=== Services ===\n Veteran Heart of the Terebinth (17)\n\n\n=== Foes ===\nInsect\nFirefly (17)\n\n\n== References ==",

      "strName": "House zu Heltzer",
      "strWikiText": "The House zu Heltzer was once the seat of one of the oldest and largest Kurzick families in the Echovald Forest dedicated to the worship of the goddess Dwayna, but is now reduced to ruins being excavated by Canthan archaeologists after Emperor Usoku and the Ministry of Purity had forcibily annexed the Kurzicks into the Empire of the Dragon centuries ago. With the growing interest in Kurzick nostalgia among modern Canthans after the dissolution of the Ministry of Purity, the site has seen an increase in the number of tourists. Although the house has fallen and no longer holds political power in Cantha, some descendants of the zu Heltzer bloodline still exist to this day.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nAfter the Kurzicks settled into the Echovald Forest in Cantha, House zu Heltzer became one of the major houses and was eventually regarded as the most influential noble family among the Kurzicks. The family worshipped Dwayna, the Goddess of Healing, Air, and Life. Wallows personified the traits of House zu Heltzer because the house was seen as sturdy, vast, and strong above others. In addition to the wallows' impressive strength and resilience, their bonds with family—blood or chosen—were seen as extremely strong. The shield became the signature weapon of House zu Heltzer. This information would be used for one of the puzzles involving the Kurzick houses within the Valdhertz Crypts to prevent anyone unfamiliar with Kurzick lore from accessing the treasure within.\nUnder Kaineng Tah the Empire of the Dragon had reached peaceful pacts with both of the less-developed cultures with which Cantha shared a continent, making the Kurzicks and Luxons subjects of the first emperor. When Kaineng Tah's successor Yian Zho began a bloody campaign to quell what he called insurgencies in Luxon and Kurzick territories. Like the Luxons before them, the Kurzicks were likely driven to unity by the belligerence of the new emperor after he had brutally put down a relatively small Kurzick uprising in 51 CC (459 BE). This, coupled with the new threat of a unified Luxon state in the Jade Sea, led directly to Kurzick unity and the forming of the Council of Nobles where House zu Heltzer held significant political power. Yian Zho was unable to drive the Kurzicks from the Echovald; however, he was able to contain them within those loose borders and was convinced by advisors to arrive at the same arrangement forged with the Luxons to turn the Kurzicks into a vassal state. Unlike their neighbors, the Kurzicks remained much more isolated, which might have been the driving force behind the intense competition between the Great Houses for domination within their own unique political structure.\n\nArborstone, also known as Cathedral zu Heltzer, became the Great House's seat of power and one of the most impressive feats of Kurzick architecture. Lord Stein zu Heltzer designed Fort Aspenwood before 1082 CC (572 AE), and it would serve as a key strategic location in the region during the many skirmishes at the ever-shifting Kurzick/Luxon border.\nSaint Viktor zu Heltzer was a renowned Kurzick champion during the reign of Emperor Angsiyan. Though not often admitted by the government, the emperor's bodyguard Shiro Tagachi was an integral part of the peace treaties Angsiyan was forming with the bickering Kurzicks and Luxons, and was the one who convinced their champions to work together and attend the Harvest Ceremony alongside the emperor at the Harvest Temple where both Saint Viktor and Archemorus had received their power from. When Shiro unexpectedly betrayed Angsiyan and slew him during the Harvest Ceremony of 1382 CC (872 AE), Saint Viktor and Archemorus who had been accompanying the emperor's retinue rushed to the top of the temple to confront him. With help from the assassin Vizu, the two champions were able to slay Shiro, only to witness him unleash the magic of Dwayna which he had stolen from the emperor in a twisted death wail which created the Jade Wind that petrified the three heroes as well as much of the Echovald Forest and the Jade Sea.\nAs a result of this catastrophe, Kurzick and Luxon hostilities resumed. Unable to farm for themselves in forests turned to stone or to fish in seas that had become jade, they instead competed for the jade itself and the rare mineral found within it, becoming increasingly more independent while the empire began a lengthy recovery from the aftermath of the assassination and the resulting disaster. The Urn of Saint Viktor became a holy relic for the Kurzicks.\nIn the following centuries the counts of House zu Heltzer took great pride in being descendants of the famous Kurzick champion. House zu Heltzer also deserved much of the credit for the Kurzicks' cultural renaissance of philosophy, magic, medicine, and art in the tumultous centuries after the Jade Wind. They became renowned for their magical innovations, their lifesaving techniques, and their practical methods of enchanting and shaping the stone that made up the transformed Echovald Forest. They also became well-versed in the arts of magical wards and protection. If there was one thing they were better at shaping than stone, it was political thought, as their continued leadership role among the Great Houses attested.\n\n\n=== Guild Wars Factions ===\n\nAs Danika grew up as the daughter of Count Petrov zu Heltzer, she became frustrated with the Kurzicks' isolationist policies, which she believed could only lead to the further decline of her people, and her world. She was eager to venture into the world outside the Echovald Forest, and find new allies for all the Kurzicks. Her sense of justice was strong, and she would be among the first of the Kurzicks to set aside factional differences should a greater threat arise. She had even had some contact, against her father’s strict orders, with House Vasburg, the longtime rivals of House zu Heltzer.\n\n\n=== Guild Wars: Eye of the North ===\nIn 1588 CC (1078 AE), Danika traveled to Gunnar's Hold in the Far Shiverpeaks to enter the norn fighting tournament against other notable heroes coming from all over Tyria, Elona, and Cantha to determine which one of them would earn the honor of facing the invincible norn warrior Magni the Bison in single combat. Aided by her wallows Brutus and Sheena, Danika eventually faced the Hero of Tyria in combat. She lost after a fierce struggle and admired the Hero's strength and resolve. Danika also spectated and commented on the fights between opponents in the tournament.\n\n\n=== Interim years ===\nDanika eventually succeeded her father as the new head of House zu Heltzer. When Emperor Usoku and the Ministry of Purity began a campaign to subjugate the Echovald Forest in 1637 CC (1127 AE), the proud Kurzicks met them in battle. However, unlike their previous conflicts against other ambitious emperors, the Kurzicks found Usoku to be a more dangerous foe with a well-equipped army. When defeat seemed all but certain, Countess Danika ordered the zu Heltzer children to be smuggled to safety before the Ministry could harm them. The descendants would scatter throughout Cantha with some even ending up abroad. When the Kurzicks fell, Danika's body was hidden so the Ministry of Purity could not desecrate it.\nWhen the Elder Dragon Zhaitan's awakening made Orr rise from the Sea of Sorrows in 1729 CC (1219 AE), the resulting massive tidal wave swept over northern Cantha and drowned and destroyed much of Old Kaineng City. Emperor Kyobok and most of the Imperial Family, royal guards and servants as well as Kurzick ambassadors Asmund zu Heltzer and Eira zu Heltzer were found dead amidst the rubble in Raisu Palace based on the report of a rescue team headed by Minister Zal and Jimin who had managed to breach into the throne room. Increased Risen activity in the ruins prevented the pair from investigating further. The zu Heltzer ambassadors were assumed to have been held captive by the emperor when the tsunami had hit the palace.\nAfter the Ministry of Purity had fallen in the decades since the Great Tsunami and a more benevolent regime led by Empress Haebaragi had risen to power, Countess Danika was reinterred in the house's memorial site so she could finally rest alongside her relatives. Interest in Kurzick history sparked among Canthans in the decades that followed, leading to both archeologists and tourists to visit the Zu Heltzer Historical Site which would also be targeted by the belligerent Speakers who intended to steal the valuable Kurzick relics within and to enslave the Kurzick ghosts wandering around.\n\n\n=== End of Dragons ===\nIn 1845 CC (1335 AE), the archeologist Valeria learned that Detective Rama had mentioned possibly being descended from House zu Heltzer. Valeria had always suspected that the house had not been fully wiped out, so she asked Rama's friend, the Pact Commander, to investigate whether any zu Heltzers had survived the Ministry of Purity's purges. The quest led the Commander to locate one of Countess Danika's personal possessions and dedicate it to her memory at her grave.\nWhen the Commander paid their respects at Danika's grave, the countess's ghost suddenly materialized. Danika calmed the Commander down, not viewing her spectral appearance as anything unusual given the circumstances. When the Commander told Danika about seeking the remains of the zu Heltzers, the countess was quick to correct the Commander as she revealed how she had safeguarded the descendants of her house by having them smuggled away during the war centuries ago. Impressed by the Commander's determination, Danika asked them to look for the missing zu Heltzer tapestry pieces from Cantha and abroad so that the pieces could be made whole, and the descendants could be reminded of their heritage and reunite the distant branches of the noble house.\nAlthough the investigations revealed that five of the branches had died out, three branches still remained, and two of these descendants were revealed to be Detective Rama and Captain Hao Luen of Lion's Arch. Valeria contracted the tengu Master Weaver Kubo to reassemble the tapestry; upon investigating a piece of cloth Valeria had inherited from her father out of curiosity, Kubo informed her that it was part of the same tapestry and Valeria was a zu Heltzer descendant as well. Upon claiming the final missing piece from Rama, Kubo and Valeria were able to reassemble the tapestry, placing it in a visible spot in the recently revived hub at Arborstone.\nIn the following weeks, the surviving zu Heltzer descendants kept in contact and found out that each of them had the same freakishly long second toe. The Canthan branches of zu Heltzer had their first reunion in centuries with the hope of planning something bigger in the future to include the Tyrian branches as well. Valeria was voted to act as the new head of the house; she speculated that she was just on the hook to make reservations for future get-togethers but she was nevertheless honored.\n\n\n== Historical bases ==\nCantha\nArborstone\nThe Echovald Wilds\nZu Heltzer Historical Site\n\n\n== Family tree ==\nClick here to show/hide annotations.\n\n\n== Related achievements ==\n The Echovald Wilds: Cultures of Echovald: The Kurzicks — Participate in all the events related to Kurzick culture.
