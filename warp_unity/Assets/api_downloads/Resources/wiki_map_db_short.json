Originally accessed by talking to Moto in Creator's Commons, it is a \"game within a game\" with an 8-bit platformer theme, sharing some elements with jumping puzzles, and uses the same enter mechanism as dungeons and thus can be completed alone or with a group of up to five players. The activity is character-based: any items and upgrades obtained on one character do not carry over to other characters. While inside, players are able to earn Bauble Bubbles that can be exchanged with Moto for various items.\nAll players start off on equal ground: Players will be under a hidden transform effect, effectively making all skills inaccessible except for the ones give\n",
