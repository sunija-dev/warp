The magic light of knowledge keep only I

An old friend is seeking knowledge. You might want to pay her a visit.

# start/help
No, but this will help you find my sunken treasures:

# tears (Guilty Tears Fall at the edge of winter zone)
As I wish to be as gods are smart
Learn knowledge pure, forbidden art
Guilty tears fall upon my freezing heart

# queensdale (Holzfäller an See, Holz im See)
I watched where trees were to swim
By humans, though, not their own kin

# garrenhoff (Fliegender Magierturm, Stadt untendran ist ein bissschen sein Merch-Store)
True magic I seeked from magician's wares
Not tricksters playing at town's faires
but those who made the town theirs

# caledon (bridge to brid people kingdom, no other races allowed)
I traved where the birds do walk
but humans don't, and neither talk
//so I got only halfway across the bridge, couldn't even knock

# lions arch (a tunnel behind a lion statue in a sunken city)
Searched sunken treasures in the sunken city
In paths behind the guarding kitty


# orrrrrr ("Hope Falls", in a city reemerged from the depths)
I visited another - as this one left my goal undue -
Which reemerged from depths of blue
Not that there my hope falls too

("Mirror's Handle", vista point looking at the sea)
Stared in the mirror to find me
But rather looking from the handle to the sea
Unraveled the endless deep as the key

(Versunkene Steinmetzwerkstatt, hat Götterstatue der schönsten Göttin versucht, wahnsinnig geworden)
Tried to learn from captured beauty in the master's piece
But learned that mastery might even decrease
My longing for an inner peace

# rata (Section of a city, that is not named after the ones named. Googles to jump in water)
Fed up with authority, memories, development and mystics
I put on some goggles to study inherent ballistics

# iceberg (City on an iceberg)
Most of myself remains under the surface, buried
Like ice in water that the city carried

# feuerpond (Teich zwischen Lava)
My journey was a pond of water, a save place
opposing the unknown's firey embrace

# sonnet (Book "Before history" at the beginning of the yourney)
To end the journey, we go home
Where I hid words in an ancient tome
To bring you this puzzle of knowledge, this mystery
That I wrote before history.






First ways true revelation dawn world young 
humanity magic gifts thought conscious night uncloaked armor
unarmed knowledge dark light child pity helpless creation
wild I poet History behold over which new

take keep watch surveys shifts bless

Wild magic 
Knowledge is light in night, wild magic of true gods.
the wild magic I behold.
Knowledge is wiedling light at night, true magic of humanity.
4/4 - 

Dawn from night, 
Knowledge through thought, magic by gods, 
Behold my child
only I.
Magic gifts
which keep only I.
The magic light of knowledge keep only I.

a magician isn't part of carnival
but made the town his carnivalthe
but made the town theirs

traveled where the birds walked
but no human did
and even I only made it halfway across the bridge

only there, I could find my ground
key

wanted to learn from the master, that captured beauty
but learned that mastery doesn't come with content
maybe even opposite

//where the guardians guard the path

most of myself is below the surface
as icebergs are, when they carry cities
swimming city

you finish where you started
i took my words from a book
how I knew? for you a mystery
i wrote itfdse before history
